{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I've heard about object-level security in databases. Can you tell me more about it in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, object-level security is implemented through access policies. These policies can restrict which objects can be selected, inserted, updated, or deleted by a particular query. It's similar to SQL's row-level security. Would you like to see an example of how this works in a schema?"}, {"human": "Yes, that would be great. Can you show me an example with a blog schema?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's start with a simple blog schema without any access policies. Here's how it might look:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required username: str;\n  required password_hash: str;\n}\n\ntype BlogPost {\n  required title: str;\n  required content: str;\n  published_at: datetime;\n  author: User;\n}\n```This schema defines a `User` type with a username and password hash, and a `BlogPost` type with a title, content, a publication date, and a link to its author. Next, we can add access policies to this schema. Would you like to proceed with that?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me how to add access policies to restrict access.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say we want to create an access policy on the `BlogPost` type that only allows a user to select blog posts that they authored. We can add an access policy like this:\n```sdl\ntype BlogPost {\n  required title: str;\n  required content: str;\n  published_at: datetime;\n  author: User;\n\n  access policy select_blog_posts {\n    using (author = current_user())\n    allow\n  }\n}\n```The `using` expression in the access policy checks if the `author` of the blog post is the same as the `current_user()`. If the condition is true, the `allow` keyword permits the operation. This way, users can only select their own blog posts. Does that make sense?"}, {"human": "It does, thanks! But what if I want to allow users to update or delete their posts as well?", "assistant": "To allow users to update or delete their own posts, you would add additional access policies for those operations. Here's how you can modify the schema to include update and delete policies:\n```sdl\ntype BlogPost {\n  required title: str;\n  required content: str;\n  published_at: datetime;\n  author: User;\n\n  access policy select_blog_posts {\n    using (author = current_user())\n    allow\n  }\n\n  access policy update_blog_posts {\n    using (author = current_user())\n    allow\n  }\n\n  access policy delete_blog_posts {\n    using (author = current_user())\n    allow\n  }\n}\n```Each access policy specifies the operation it applies to in its name and uses the same `using` condition to check the authorship. Now users can select, update, and delete only their own blog posts. Would you like to know how to apply these policies in practice?"}, {"human": "Yes, that would be helpful. How do I use these policies in a query?", "assistant": "When you write a query in EdgeQL, the access policies are automatically applied based on the current user's context. For example, if a user tries to select all blog posts, the query will only return the posts that they are allowed to see according to the access policies. Here's an example query:\n```edgeql\nSELECT BlogPost {\n  title,\n  content,\n  published_at\n};\n```This query will return only the blog posts authored by the current user, as defined by the `select_blog_posts` access policy. Similarly, update and delete operations will only affect the user's own posts. The database enforces these policies transparently, so you don't need to include any additional checks in your queries. Does that clarify how access policies work in practice?"}, {"human": "Absolutely, thanks for the explanation! I'll try implementing these in my project.", "assistant": "You're welcome!

For example, you might use a global variable to represent the identity of the current user."}, {"human": "That sounds useful. How do I define a global variable in my schema?", "assistant": "To define a global variable, you'll add it to your schema using the SDL (Schema Definition Language).

And how would I use this global variable in practice?", "assistant": "In practice, you would set the `current_user_id` global variable at the beginning of a session or transaction to the identity of the user who is currently logged in. Then, you can use this variable in your EdgeQL queries to filter results based on the user's identity, or to enforce access control rules."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use the global variable in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a `Post` type in your schema and you want to fetch all posts created by the current user. You could write an EdgeQL query like this:\n```\nSELECT Post\nFILTER Post.creator_id = global current_user_id;\n```"}, {"human": "That's pretty clear. Is there anything else I should know about globals?", "assistant": "Just remember that globals are not meant to store permanent data. They are session-based and should be used for contextual information like user sessions. Also, make sure to manage them carefully to avoid security issues, such as unauthorized access."}]}

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how EdgeDB handles access control. Can you explain how it resolves multiple access policies on an object type?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, an object type can have multiple access policies, and sometimes these policies might conflict with each other. EdgeDB uses a specific algorithm to resolve these conflicts. Would you like me to go through the steps of the resolution algorithm?"}, {"human": "Yes, please. I'm curious about how it works when there are conflicting policies.", "assistant": "Alright. When there are multiple access policies on an object type, EdgeDB will resolve them in the following way: \n1. If no policies are defined on a given object type, all objects of that type can be read or modified by any appropriately authenticated user. \n\nThis is just the first step. There are more steps involved in the resolution process when policies are actually defined. Do you want to continue with the next steps?"}, {"human": "Yes, please continue.", "assistant": "I apologize, but it seems that the rest of the resolution algorithm isn't included in the snippet of documentation provided. However, based on the first step, we can infer that the resolution order is designed to ensure that when no explicit policies are set, the default behavior is permissive, allowing authenticated users to access the objects. For more detailed steps, we would need to refer to the full documentation on access policy resolution in EdgeDB."}, {"human": "I see, that makes sense. So without any policies, it's like an open door for authenticated users. Can you show me how to define a simple access policy in SDL?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's an example of how you might define an access policy in SDL for a `Movie` type. This policy allows any authenticated user to read movies, but only allows users with the 'admin' role to update or delete them.\n\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n\n  access policy allow_all_read {\n    using (true);\n    allow read;\n  }\n\n  access policy restrict_write_to_admins {\n    using (SELECT 'admin' = sys::get_current_role_name());\n    allow update, delete;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `allow_all_read` is an access policy that allows read access to all authenticated users, and `restrict_write_to_admins` only allows update and delete operations if the current user has the 'admin' role. Remember that the actual resolution of these policies will follow the algorithm EdgeDB uses when multiple policies are present."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to insert data into my EdgeDB database, but I keep getting an 'AccessPolicyError'. What does that mean?", "assistant": "Hello! An 'AccessPolicyError' in EdgeDB indicates that the query you're trying to run is violating an access policy that's been set up on your database. This is a security feature that restricts write operations like insertions based on certain rules."}, {"human": "Is there a way to customize the error message? The default one is a bit generic.", "assistant": "As of the current documentation, EdgeDB provides a generic error message for access policy violations. It doesn't support custom error messages for these violations, so you'll receive a standard message indicating the type of error, such as 'access policy violation on insert'."}, {"human": "So, every time there's a restricted access, I'll get an error message?", "assistant": "Not necessarily. Restricted access can result in an error message, or it might simply result in an empty set being returned, depending on how the access policy's filtering is ordered. If the policy leads to a restriction that filters out all possible data, you might just get an empty set without an explicit error."}, {"human": "I see. Can you show me an example of an access policy that might trigger this error?", "assistant": "Certainly!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to set up access policies in EdgeDB. Can you explain how it works with an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! Access policies in EdgeDB are used to control who can read or write to specific objects in the database. For instance, let's say you have a blog platform where posts are publicly visible if they are published, but only the author of the post should be able to write to it. Here's how you might define this in SDL:"}, {"human": "Okay, show me the SDL definition.", "assistant": "```sdl\nglobal current_user -> uuid;\n\ntype User {\n    required email -> str {\n        constraint exclusive;\n    }\n}\n\ntype BlogPost {\n    required title -> str;\n    required author -> User;\n    required published -> bool {\n        default := false;\n    };\n    access policy author_only {\n        using (author = current_user);\n        allow update;\n    }\n    access policy public_read {\n        using (published = true);\n        allow select;\n    }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see there's a 'global current_user' and two access policies. Can you break down what each part does?", "assistant": "Sure! The `global current_user` is a placeholder for the ID of the user who is currently interacting with the database. It's used within access policies to reference the current user.\n\nThe `author_only` access policy uses a condition `using (author = current_user)` to check if the `author` of the `BlogPost` is the same as the `current_user`. If the condition is true, it allows the `update` operation, meaning the author can modify their own post.\n\nThe `public_read` access policy allows anyone to `select` (read) a `BlogPost` if the `published` field is set to `true`, indicating that the post is publicly visible."}, {"human": "What if I want to allow the author to delete their post as well?", "assistant": "To allow the author to delete their post, you would modify the `author_only` access policy to also include the `delete` operation. Here's the updated SDL:\n```sdl\ntype BlogPost {\n    required title -> str;\n    required author -> User;\n    required published -> bool {\n        default := false;\n    };\n    access policy author_only {\n        using (author = current_user);\n        allow update, delete;\n    }\n    access policy public_read {\n        using (published = true);\n        allow select;\n    }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how would I apply these policies in practice?", "assistant": "In practice, you would set the `current_user` global to the ID of the user who is currently logged in or making a request. Then, when operations are performed on `BlogPost` objects, EdgeDB will automatically enforce the access policies based on the `current_user` and the conditions specified in the `using` clauses. If a user tries to perform an operation that is not allowed by any policy, EdgeDB will reject the operation."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I heard about super constraints in EdgeDB. Can you tell me more about them?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, access policies can be used to define what are known as 'super constraints'. These are essentially validity checks that are applied after a write operation, such as an `insert` or an `update write`. If the check fails, the write operation is rolled back, ensuring that the data remains consistent with the defined constraints."}, {"human": "Interesting. So how exactly do these super constraints work in practice?", "assistant": "Super constraints work by using EdgeQL within access policies. You can write an EdgeQL expression that defines the condition that must be met for the write operation to be considered valid. If the condition is not met, the operation is undone. Here's a simple example of an access policy that acts as a super constraint:\n```\nmodule default {\n  type User {\n    required property name -> str;\n    property age -> int16;\n\n    policy on insert {\n      using (age >= 18)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the policy ensures that a `User` can only be inserted if their age is 18 or older. If someone tries to insert a `User` with an age less than 18, the insert operation will fail and be rolled back."}, {"human": "Got it. But the documentation mentioned something about a limitation with Postgres. What's that about?", "assistant": "Ah, yes. The documentation notes that due to an underlying Postgres limitation, constraints on object types can only reference certain elements. Unfortunately, the documentation snippet you provided doesn't include the full details of this limitation. However, typically, this means that there might be restrictions on referencing volatile functions or other database objects that are not directly related to the object type the constraint is defined on."}, {"human": "I see. So I should be careful when defining these super constraints to make sure they don't hit any Postgres limitations?", "assistant": "Exactly. It's important to be aware of the underlying database's capabilities and limitations when defining constraints. If you're ever unsure about whether a particular constraint might be affected by a Postgres limitation, it's a good idea to consult the EdgeDB documentation or seek advice from the EdgeDB community for guidance."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I've been working with EdgeDB and I keep seeing the term 'alias'. Can you explain what that is?", "assistant": "Certainly! An alias in EdgeDB is essentially a pointer to a set of values. This set is defined by an EdgeQL expression. Think of it as a way to create a shorthand for a query that you can use elsewhere in your EdgeQL queries."}, {"human": "So it's like a view in SQL?", "assistant": "Yes, that's a good analogy. An alias is similar to a view in SQL in that it represents a stored query that you can reference. However, unlike a SQL view, an alias is evaluated on the fly whenever it's referenced."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to define an alias?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you frequently need to get a list of movies that were released after the year 2000. You can define an alias for this query like this:\n```\nalias MoviesAfter2000 := (SELECT Movie FILTER .release_year > 2000);\n```Now, whenever you need that list, you can simply use `MoviesAfter2000` in your EdgeQL queries."}, {"human": "That looks useful. How would I use it in another query?", "assistant": "You can use the alias just like you would use any other set. For example, if you want to get the titles of movies released after 2000, you could write:\n```\nSELECT MoviesAfter2000 { title };\n```This query will return the titles of all movies in your `MoviesAfter2000` alias."}, {"human": "What if I want to modify the alias? Do I need to redefine it?", "assistant": "Yes, if you want to change the definition of an alias, you would redefine it. Aliases are not stored in the database schema, so they are flexible and can be changed as needed by redefining them in your EdgeQL code."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about aliases or anything else in EdgeDB, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to add some annotations to my EdgeDB schema, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can use annotations to add metadata to your schema items. There are several standard annotations available such as `title`, `description`, and `deprecated`. Would you like an example of how to use them?"}, {"human": "Yes, that would be great. How do I add a title and description to a type in my schema?", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's how you can add a `title` and `description` to a type in your SDL (Schema Definition Language): \n```sdl\ntype Status {\n    annotation title := 'Activity status';\n    annotation description := 'Represents the current status of an activity.';\n}\n``` \nThis will set the title of the `Status` type to 'Activity status' and its description to 'Represents the current status of an activity.'."}, {"human": "What about marking something as deprecated? How would I do that?", "assistant": "To mark a schema item as deprecated, you can use the `deprecated` annotation like this: \n```sdl\ntype Status {\n    annotation title := 'Activity status';\n    annotation description := 'Represents the current status of an activity.';\n    annotation deprecated := 'This type will be removed in future versions.';\n}\n``` \nThis adds a note to the `Status` type indicating that it is deprecated and will be removed in future versions."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And these annotations can be set on any schema item, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! You can set the `title`, `description`, and `deprecated` annotations on any schema item, including types, functions, constraints, and more. They're used to provide additional context and documentation within your schema."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I heard that EdgeDB allows you to add custom annotations to your schema. Can you tell me more about that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can declare custom annotation types to attach arbitrary metadata to your schema elements. This can be particularly useful for introspection and code generation. You can define a custom annotation by adding an abstract annotation type to your schema."}, {"human": "That sounds useful. How do I define a custom annotation?", "assistant": "To define a custom annotation, you use the `abstract annotation` declaration in your schema definition language (SDL). Here's an example of how you might define an annotation called `admin_note`:"}, {"human": "Could you show me an example of that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you would define the `admin_note` annotation in SDL:\n```sdl\nabstract annotation admin_note;\n```"}, {"human": "Great, and how would I use this annotation in my schema?", "assistant": "Once you've defined the `admin_note` annotation, you can use it on any schema item like a type, property, or link. For example, if you have a type called `Status`, you can annotate it like this:\n```sdl\ntype Status {\n    admin_note := 'This status is used for...';\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see. And can I use any type of data for the annotation value?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use any JSON-encodable data for the annotation value. This means you can attach strings, numbers, objects, or arrays as metadata to your schema elements."}, {"human": "That's really flexible. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or schema annotations, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I've been using SQL databases for a while, but I keep hearing about EdgeDB. Can you tell me how it compares to SQL in terms of schema representation?", "assistant": "Certainly! In traditional SQL databases, the schema is represented through a series of `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DELETE` commands for tables and columns. These commands are typically spread across various SQL migration scripts. As a result, there's no straightforward way to view the entire current state of your schema at a glance."}, {"human": "That's true, it can be a pain to track changes. How does EdgeDB handle schema representation differently?", "assistant": "EdgeDB introduces a more convenient way to handle schema representation. Instead of piecing together the schema from multiple migration scripts, EdgeDB uses a declarative schema definition language (SDL). This allows you to define your entire schema in a more readable and maintainable way. You can see the structure of your data models and their relationships clearly in one place."}, {"human": "That sounds useful. Can you show me a simple example of what an EdgeDB schema looks like?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's a basic example of an EdgeDB schema using SDL to define a `Movie` type with a title and a link to multiple actors of type `Person`:\n``sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n}\n``\nAs you can see, the syntax is clean and easy to understand, showing the properties and links of the `Movie` type in a straightforward manner."}, {"human": "Wow, that is much clearer. How do I make changes to the schema once it's defined?", "assistant": "To make changes to an existing schema in EdgeDB, you would create a migration script using EdgeDB's migration tools. These tools help you generate a migration script that describes the changes to be applied. You can review and adjust this script if necessary before applying it to update the schema. This process ensures that the schema evolution is well-documented and manageable."}, {"human": "Thanks for the explanation! I'll definitely consider using EdgeDB for my next project.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask. Good luck with your projects!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I've been working with EdgeDB and I'm curious about computed properties and links. Can you tell me more about them?", "assistant": "Absolutely! Computed properties and links in EdgeDB are elements of an object type that are not stored in the database directly. Instead, they are evaluated on the fly whenever they are fetched. This means their values are calculated based on other data in the database or some logic you define."}, {"human": "So, they're like functions that run when I query for them?", "assistant": "Exactly! They're similar to functions that get executed during a query. You define a computed property or link with an EdgeQL expression that determines its value. This expression can use the data of the object itself or even join with other objects."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of a computed property in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure, here's a simple example of a computed property in SDL for a `Person` type that calculates the full name from first and last names:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  first_name -> str;\n  last_name -> str;\n  full_name := .first_name ++ ' ' ++ .last_name;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `full_name` is a computed property that concatenates the `first_name` and `last_name` with a space in between."}, {"human": "I see, and what about computed links?", "assistant": "Computed links are defined similarly, but they reference other objects. For instance, if you want to create a computed link that fetches all the books written by an author, you could define it like this:\n``sdl\ntype Author {\n  # ... other properties ...\n  books := (SELECT Book FILTER .author = .id);\n}\n``\nHere, `books` is a computed link that selects all `Book` objects where the `author` property matches the `Author` object's `id`."}, {"human": "Got it. And these computed properties and links are recalculated every time I fetch the object?", "assistant": "Yes, that's correct. They are recalculated every time you fetch the object, which means they always return the most up-to-date value based on the current state of the database and the logic you've defined."}, {"human": "Are there any performance considerations I should be aware of?", "assistant": "Since computed properties and links are evaluated on the fly, they can impact performance if the computation is complex or if it involves joining large datasets. It's important to use them judiciously and consider caching or persisting data if you find performance issues."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how to reference the current object in EdgeDB. Can you explain how that works?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, when you're inside the scope of an object type declaration, you can reference the current object using the special keyword `__source__`. It's similar to `this` or `self` in many object-oriented languages. However, you can also use a shorthand notation by simply using a leading dot."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use this leading dot notation?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you have a type `Person` and you want to define a computed property that references another property of the same object. Here's how you could do it using the leading dot notation in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  first_name: str;\n  last_name: str;\n  full_name := .first_name ++ ' ' ++ .last_name;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `.first_name` and `.last_name` are using the leading dot notation to refer to the `first_name` and `last_name` properties of the current `Person` object."}, {"human": "So, I don't need to use `__source__` at all?", "assistant": "That's correct. While `__source__` is available for you to use, it's optional in this context. The leading dot notation is a more concise way to refer to the current object's properties or links within its type declaration."}, {"human": "Is this leading dot notation specific to SDL, or can it be used in EdgeQL queries as well?", "assistant": "The leading dot notation is specific to SDL and is used within type declarations. In EdgeQL queries, you would typically use the `SELECT` statement and aliases to refer to the current object. However, the concept is similar in that you're accessing properties of an object in context."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for clarifying! This will make my type declarations much cleaner.", "assistant": "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how computed fields work in EdgeDB. Can you explain how type and cardinality are determined for these fields?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the type and cardinality of a computed field are inferred from the expression you use to define that field. Unlike non-computed fields, you don't need to explicitly use modifier keywords like `multi` or `required` for computed fields. However, it's still common practice to specify these modifiers to make the schema more readable and to serve as a sanity check. If the EdgeQL expression you provide doesn't match the specified modifiers, you'll get an error, which helps ensure that your schema behaves as expected."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of a computed field in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example of a computed field in SDL. Let's say we have a `Person` type and we want to add a computed field that concatenates the first and last name to create a full name:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  first_name: str;\n  last_name: str;\n  full_name := .first_name ++ ' ' ++ .last_name;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `full_name` is a computed field. Its type is inferred to be `str` because it's the result of concatenating two strings. The cardinality is inferred to be 'single' because the concatenation of two single strings results in a single string."}, {"human": "What if I want to make sure the full_name is always available and not optional?", "assistant": "If you want to ensure that `full_name` is always available, you can explicitly specify it as `required` in the SDL, like this:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  first_name: str;\n  last_name: str;\n  required full_name := .first_name ++ ' ' ++ .last_name;\n}\n``\nBy doing this, you're indicating that `full_name` must always have a value, which acts as a sanity check against the EdgeQL expression. If the expression could potentially result in a `null` value, you would get an error."}, {"human": "What happens if the expression could return multiple values? How do I handle that?", "assistant": "If the expression for a computed field could return multiple values, you can use the `multi` keyword to indicate that the field can have multiple values. Here's an example where we compute a field that lists all email addresses associated with a person:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  first_name: str;\n  last_name: str;\n  multi email_addresses := (\n    SELECT .<person[IS Email].address\n  );\n}\n``\nIn this case, `email_addresses` is a computed field that could contain multiple email addresses. By using the `multi` keyword, we're specifying that this field can have multiple values, which is consistent with the possible results of the EdgeQL expression."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I've been using EdgeDB and I find myself writing the same filter expression over and over. Is there a way to make this more efficient?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can define a computed field in your schema that encapsulates the filter expression you frequently use. This way, you can reuse the logic without having to write the filter each time. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, let's say you have a `Club` type that has a list of `members`, and you often need to filter these members to get only the active ones. You can define a computed field called `active_members` that does this for you. Here's how you can define it in your schema definition language (SDL): \n```sdl\ntype Club {\n  multi members: Person;\n  multi active_members := (\n    select .members filter .is_active = true\n  )\n}\n\ntype Person {\n  name: str;\n  is_active: bool;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That's neat! So, how do I use this computed field in my queries?", "assistant": "Once you've defined the computed field in your schema, you can use it just like any other field. For example, if you want to get the list of active members for a particular club, you can write a query like this: \n```edgeql\nSELECT Club {\n  active_members: {\n    name\n  }\n}\nFILTER .name = 'Some Club Name';\n``` \nThis query will return the names of active members for the club with the name 'Some Club Name'."}, {"human": "Got it. And this computed field is read-only, right? I can't modify `active_members` directly?", "assistant": "Correct, computed fields are read-only. They are calculated at query time and do not store any data themselves. If you want to change which members are active, you would update the `is_active` property on the `Person` instances, not the `active_members` computed field on the `Club`."}, {"human": "Thanks for clarifying. This will definitely make my queries cleaner and more manageable!", "assistant": "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand backlinks in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, links are directional, meaning they have a source and a target. Backlinks are a way to traverse these links in the reverse direction. This is often useful when you want to access all the items that link to a particular item."}, {"human": "I see. How would I define a backlink in my schema?", "assistant": "To define a backlink, you would use a computed link in your schema. Here's an example using a blog scenario:\n```sdl\ntype BlogPost {\n  title: str;\n  author: User;\n}\n\ntype User {\n  name: str;\n  multi blog_posts := .<author[is BlogPost];\n}\n```\nIn this schema, `User` has a computed link `blog_posts` that represents the backlink. It retrieves all `BlogPost` instances where the `author` link points to the `User` instance."}, {"human": "Got it. So the '<' symbol is used to indicate the reverse direction?", "assistant": "Exactly! The '<' symbol is used before the link name to indicate that you want to traverse the link in the reverse direction. In the example, `.<author[is BlogPost]` means 'get me all the `BlogPost` instances where the `author` is this `User`'."}, {"human": "And what does the `[is BlogPost]` part do?", "assistant": "The `[is BlogPost]` part is a type filter. It ensures that only instances of `BlogPost` are considered when traversing the backlink. This is useful when the link could point to instances of different types, and you want to restrict the results to a specific type."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand constraints in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are?", "assistant": "Sure! Constraints in EdgeDB allow you to define rules that determine which data is considered valid in your database. They can be applied to properties, links, object types, and custom scalars to enforce data integrity and business logic."}, {"human": "Could you give me an example of a simple property constraint?", "assistant": "Absolutely! Here's an example of a constraint that ensures the uniqueness of a username for a User type in SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n``sdl\ntype User {\n  required username: str {\n    constraint exclusive\n  }\n}\n``\nThis `exclusive` constraint ensures that each `username` is unique across all User objects."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to insert a User with a username that already exists?", "assistant": "If you try to insert a User with a username that already exists, EdgeDB will raise a constraint violation error because the `exclusive` constraint on the `username` property prevents duplicate values."}, {"human": "Can I define custom constraints or am I limited to predefined ones?", "assistant": "You can definitely define custom constraints using EdgeQL, EdgeDB's query language. This allows you to create more complex validation rules that are specific to your application's needs. Predefined constraints like `exclusive` are just there to cover common use cases."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to set constraints on properties in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can define constraints on properties to enforce certain rules. For example, you can ensure that a string property has a maximum length or that its value is unique across all instances of a type."}, {"human": "I see. Could you show me an example of how to set a maximum length on a username property?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you can define a `User` type with a `username` property that must be unique and have a maximum length of 25 characters:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required username: str {\n    # usernames must be unique\n    constraint exclusive;\n    # max length (built-in)\n    constraint max_len_value(25);\n  };\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And what does the `exclusive` constraint do?", "assistant": "The `exclusive` constraint ensures that the `username` property is unique across all `User` instances.

If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to create a custom scalar type in EdgeDB for usernames. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can create a custom scalar type by extending one of the built-in scalar types. For usernames, you might want to ensure they follow a specific pattern. Here's how you can define a custom scalar type for usernames with a regular expression constraint:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Sure, here's an example using SDL (Schema Definition Language) to create a custom scalar type called 'username' that extends the built-in 'str' type. It includes a regular expression constraint to ensure usernames are 4 to 20 characters long and only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores:"}, {"human": "I see, but what if I want to make sure each username is unique?", "assistant": "In EdgeDB, the concept of exclusivity, such as ensuring uniqueness, is defined in the context of a given object type rather than on the scalar type itself. So, you can't use `exclusive` constraints directly on custom scalar types. Instead, you would use an `expression` constraint within the object type that uses the custom scalar. Here's an example of how you might enforce uniqueness on a property of type 'username' within an object type:"}, {"human": "Could you provide a snippet for that?", "assistant": "Certainly! Let's say you have an object type 'User' that has a property 'name' of type 'username'. You can enforce uniqueness with an `expression` constraint like this:"}, {"human": "That makes sense.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how constraints work with type inheritance in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, when you define a constraint on a type and then create another type that extends the original, the constraint you defined on the base type is not applied individually to each subtype. Instead, it's applied globally across all types that inherit from the base type. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, let's say you have a base type called 'User' with a unique name constraint. Here's how you would define it in SDL:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required name: str {\n    constraint exclusive;\n  }\n}\n```\nNow, if you create another type called 'Administrator' that extends 'User', the 'exclusive' constraint on the 'name' field will apply to both 'User' and 'Administrator' globally. Here's how you extend the 'User' type:\n```sdl\ntype Administrator extending User {\n  // Administrator-specific fields go here\n}\n```\nThis means that you cannot have a 'User' and an 'Administrator' with the same 'name' value, as the constraint is shared across both types."}, {"human": "Got it! So if I try to insert a User and an Administrator with the same name, it will throw an error?", "assistant": "Exactly! The database will enforce the unique name constraint across both the 'User' and 'Administrator' types, preventing you from having two entries with the same name, regardless of whether they are 'User' or 'Administrator' instances."}, {"human": "What if I want to have a unique constraint only for the Administrator type?", "assistant": "If you want a unique constraint that applies only to the 'Administrator' type, you would need to define a new property on the 'Administrator' type and apply the constraint to that property. For example:\n```sdl\ntype Administrator extending User {\n  required admin_id: str {\n    constraint exclusive;\n  }\n}\n```\nThis way, the 'admin_id' would have a unique constraint that only applies to 'Administrator' instances, separate from the 'name' constraint on 'User'."}, {"human": "Makes sense. Thanks for the clarification!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB, constraints, or anything else, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use custom constraints in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can define custom constraints using the `expression` constraint. This allows you to specify a condition that must be met for the data to be considered valid. You can use the keyword `__subject__` within the constraint to reference the value that's being constrained."}, {"human": "I see. Can you show me an example of how to use a custom constraint to limit the length of a username?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example of how you might define a custom constraint in SDL to ensure that the `username` field of a `User` type doesn't exceed 25 characters:\n``sdl\ntype User {\n  required username: str {\n    # max length (as custom constraint)\n    constraint expression on (len(__subject__) <= 25);\n  };\n}\n``\nIn this example, the `expression` constraint checks that the length of the `username` is 25 characters or less."}, {"human": "Got it. And what happens if I try to insert a username that's longer than 25 characters?", "assistant": "If you try to insert a username that exceeds 25 characters, EdgeDB will raise a constraint violation error because the data does not satisfy the custom constraint you've defined. You'll need to ensure that the username is within the specified length before inserting it into the database."}, {"human": "Makes sense. Is there a way to provide a custom error message for this constraint?", "assistant": "The documentation snippet provided doesn't cover custom error messages for constraints. However, typically in database systems, you can often specify an error message that will be displayed when a constraint is violated. For detailed information on how to do this in EdgeDB, you would need to refer to the official EdgeDB documentation or other resources."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how computed constraints work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can define constraints on computed properties just like you would on regular properties. A computed property is a property whose value is derived from other properties or links. You can use a constraint to enforce certain conditions on these computed properties."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of a computed constraint?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a `User` type and you want to ensure that the username is unique, regardless of case or leading/trailing whitespace. You could define a computed property `clean_username` that normalizes the username, and then apply an `exclusive` constraint to it. Here's how you might write that in SDL:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required username: str;\n  required clean_username := str_trim(str_lower(.username));\n  constraint exclusive on (.clean_username);\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so `clean_username` is a computed property that's always in lowercase and without extra spaces. And the `exclusive` constraint ensures that no two users can have the same `clean_username`?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `str_trim` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and `str_lower` converts the username to lowercase. The `exclusive` constraint then makes sure that the `clean_username` is unique across all `User` instances in the database."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to insert a user with a username that, when trimmed and lowercased, matches an existing `clean_username`?", "assistant": "If you try to insert such a user, EdgeDB will raise a constraint violation error because the `exclusive` constraint on `clean_username` would be violated. You'll need to ensure that the username is unique after normalization before attempting to insert a new user."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand composite constraints in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, a composite constraint is used to ensure that a combination of values across multiple properties or links is unique within a given set. For example, you might want to ensure that no two blog posts have the same title and author combination. To define such a constraint, you use the `exclusive` keyword on a tuple of properties or links."}, {"human": "I see, could you show me an example of how to define this in SDL?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's how you would define a composite `exclusive` constraint on the `title` and `author` of a `BlogPost` type in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype User {\n  username: str;\n}\n\ntype BlogPost {\n  title: str;\n  author: User;\n  constraint exclusive on ((.title, .author));\n}\n``\nThis ensures that each combination of `title` and `author` in `BlogPost` entries is unique."}, {"human": "Got it. So if I try to insert two blog posts with the same title and author, EdgeDB will prevent that?", "assistant": "Exactly! If you attempt to insert a second `BlogPost` with a `title` and `author` that matches an existing entry, EdgeDB will raise an error because it violates the `exclusive` constraint you've defined."}, {"human": "What if I want to make sure the username in the User type is also unique?", "assistant": "To ensure that the `username` in the `User` type is unique, you would add an `exclusive` constraint directly on the `username` property like this:\n``sdl\ntype User {\n  username: str;\n  constraint exclusive on (.username);\n}\n``\nWith this constraint, EdgeDB will ensure that no two `User` entries have the same `username`."}, {"human": "Thanks, that makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about composite constraints?", "assistant": "You're welcome! Just remember that composite constraints are a powerful feature for maintaining data integrity. They ensure that a specific set of properties or links, when taken together, are unique across all instances of a type.

The partial constraint `except (.deleted)` means that the uniqueness of `username` is not enforced for users who have the `deleted` field set to `true`. This allows for the reuse of usernames from accounts that have been marked as deleted."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to create a new user with a username that's already taken by a non-deleted user?", "assistant": "If you attempt to create a new user with a `username` that's already in use by an existing user who is not marked as `deleted`, EdgeDB will raise a constraint violation error because the `exclusive` constraint on `username` would be violated."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks!

Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance with your schema, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to create a social network schema in EdgeDB and I want to represent the strength of friendships. How can I do that?", "assistant": "You can represent the strength of friendships in EdgeDB by using a link property. Here's an example of how you might define a `User` type with a `friends` link that includes a `strength` property to indicate the strength of each friendship:"}, {"human": "Okay, but I want to make sure that the strength value is always a positive number. Is there a way to enforce that?", "assistant": "Absolutely, you can enforce that by adding a constraint to the link property. Here's how you can modify the `User` type to ensure the `strength` property of the `friends` link is always greater than or equal to 0:"}, {"human": "Great, could you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the SDL code for the `User` type with the `friends` link and the `strength` property, including a constraint that ensures `strength` is a non-negative number:"}, {"human": "Thanks, that's really helpful!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance with your schema, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm working on a library book management app and I heard that EdgeDB has some new features for constraints. Can you tell me more about it?", "assistant": "Absolutely! Starting with EdgeDB version 4.3, you can use `@source` and `@target` constraints to create composite exclusive constraints. This means you can enforce uniqueness not just on a property of an object, but also on a link property in relation to the object it's linked to. Would you like an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please! An example would be great.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you have a `Book` type and a `User` type, and you want to track which user has checked out a book. You might have a link called `checkout` from `User` to `Book`. To ensure that a book can't be checked out to multiple users at the same time, you could use a composite exclusive constraint on the `checkout` link. Here's how you might define it in SDL:"}, {"human": "Okay, I'm following you. Show me the SDL.", "assistant": "```sdl\n type Book {\n  required title: str;\n  # Other properties...\n}\n\ntype User {\n  required name: str;\n  # Other properties...\n\n  checkout: link {\n    property checked_out_at -> datetime;\n    exclusive on (@source, @target);\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this SDL, we've defined a `checkout` link from `User` to `Book` with a `checked_out_at` property. The `exclusive` constraint is applied to both the `User` (the source of the link) and the `Book` (the target of the link) to ensure that each book is only checked out to one user at a time."}, {"human": "That's really useful! So if I understand correctly, this will prevent a book from being checked out by more than one user at the same time?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `exclusive` constraint with `@source` and `@target` ensures that the combination of the user and the book, along with the checkout time, is unique across all checkouts. This way, you can't have two users checking out the same book at the same time."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help! I'll try implementing this in my app.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance while working with EdgeDB, feel free to ask. Good luck with your library book management app!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I heard that EdgeDB allows you to define custom functions. Can you show me how to do that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can define your own functions using SDL (Schema Definition Language). For instance, if you want to create a function that adds an exclamation mark at the end of a string, you can define it like this:\n```\nsdl\nfunction exclamation(word: str) -> str\n  using (word ++ '!');\n```"}, {"human": "That looks simple enough. How would I use this function in a query?", "assistant": "You can use this function in an EdgeQL query just like you would use any built-in function. Here's an example of how to call the `exclamation` function:\n```\nedgeql\nSELECT exclamation('Hello');\n```This query would return the string 'Hello!' as the output."}, {"human": "Great, thanks! And can I pass column values to this function as well?", "assistant": "Yes, you can! If you have a table with a column that contains strings, you can pass the values of that column to the function. For example, if you have a `Movie` type with a `title` property, you can use the function like this:\n```\nedgeql\nSELECT Movie {\n  title_with_exclamation := exclamation(Movie.title)\n};\n```This will return a set of `Movie` objects with an additional computed property `title_with_exclamation` that contains the movie titles followed by an exclamation mark."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what globals are in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, globals are scalar-typed variables that you can define in your schema. They are essentially session-level data that you can reference in your queries. This can be particularly useful for storing information like the current user's ID."}, {"human": "Interesting. How do I define a global in my schema?", "assistant": "You can define a global in your schema using the SDL (Schema Definition Language). Here's an example of how you would define a global variable for the current user's ID:\n```sdl\nglobal current_user_id -> uuid;\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how would I use this global in a query?", "assistant": "You can use the `global` keyword in EdgeQL to reference a global variable in your queries. For example, if you want to select a user and their posts filtering by the current user's ID stored in the global, you would write a query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect User {\n  id,\n  posts: { title, content }\n} filter .id = global current_user_id;\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. So, the global variable acts like a placeholder that I can set for each session?", "assistant": "Exactly! You can set the value of the global variable at the beginning of the session, and then use it throughout your queries during that session. It's a convenient way to pass around session-specific data."}, {"human": "Can I update the value of a global during a session, or is it fixed?", "assistant": "The value of a global can be updated during the session. You can change it as needed to reflect any changes in the session-level data."}, {"human": "Thanks! This was really helpful.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to set up EdgeDB with TypeScript, but I'm not sure how to start. Can you help me?", "assistant": "Of course! To start using EdgeDB with TypeScript, you'll first need to import the `createClient` function from the `edgedb` package. Here's how you can do it:\n```typescript\nimport createClient from 'edgedb';\nconst baseClient = createClient();\n```\nThis will give you a new Client instance that you can use to interact with your EdgeDB instance."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And how can I set global variables for my queries?", "assistant": "You can set global variables by using the `withGlobals` method on your client instance. Here's an example where we set a global variable `current_user_id`:\n```typescript\nconst clientWithGlobals = baseClient.withGlobals({\n  current_user_id: '2141a5b4-5634-4ccc-b835-437863534c51',\n});\n```\nNow, `clientWithGlobals` will send the `current_user_id` along with all future queries."}, {"human": "That's pretty neat. So, how do I actually use `clientWithGlobals` to make a query?", "assistant": "You can use `clientWithGlobals` just like you would use the base client. Here's an example of how to execute a query with it:\n```typescript\nawait clientWithGlobals.query('SELECT User { id, name } WHERE .id = <uuid>$current_user_id');\n```\nThis query will fetch the user with the ID provided in the global variable."}, {"human": "I see. And if I need to execute a query without the global variables, should I use the base client?", "assistant": "Exactly! If you need to execute a query without the global variables, you can use the `baseClient` instance. This way, the query will be executed without any globals:\n```typescript\nawait baseClient.query('SELECT User { id, name }');\n```\nThis will fetch all users without applying the `current_user_id` filter."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use globals in EdgeDB with Python. Can you explain how that works?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, you can use globals to define variables that are accessible within the scope of a query. When using the Python client, you can set these globals for the duration of your client session. Here's an example of how you can set a global variable called 'current_user_id' and use it in a query:"}, {"human": "Okay, can you show me the code?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's a snippet of Python code that demonstrates how to set a global variable and use it in a query with EdgeDB:\n```python\nfrom edgedb import create_client\n\nclient = create_client().with_globals({\n    'current_user_id': '580cc652-8ab8-4a20-8db9-4c79a4b1fd81'\n})\n\nresult = client.query(\"\"\"\nselect global current_user_id;\n\"\"\")\nprint(result)\n```"}, {"human": "What does this code do exactly?", "assistant": "This code does the following:\n1. It imports the `create_client` function from the `edgedb` module.\n2. It creates a new EdgeDB client instance.\n3. It sets a global variable `current_user_id` with a specific UUID value for the session.\n4. It runs a query that selects the value of the `current_user_id` global.\n5. It prints the result of the query, which should be the UUID that was set as the global variable."}, {"human": "And what will be the output of this code?", "assistant": "The output of this code will be the UUID value that you set for the `current_user_id` global variable. In this case, it will print:\n```\n['580cc652-8ab8-4a20-8db9-4c79a4b1fd81']\n```"}, {"human": "Is there anything else I need to know about using globals in queries?", "assistant": "When using globals, keep in mind that they are session-specific. This means that the globals you set will only be available for the duration of the client session you set them in. Also, make sure that the globals you define are used in accordance with the schema and query logic of your EdgeDB database. Other than that, you should be good to go!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to get started with EdgeDB using Go. Can you show me how to set up a basic client connection?", "assistant": "Absolutely! Here's a simple example of how to create a client connection to EdgeDB in Go:\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"context\"\n  \"log\"\n  \"github.com/edgedb/edgedb-go\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  ctx := context.Background()\n  client, err := edgedb.CreateClient(ctx, edgedb.Options{})\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  defer client.Close()\n  // Now you can use the client to interact with the database\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Thanks! And how would I go about parsing a UUID with this client?", "assistant": "To parse a UUID, you can use the `edgedb.ParseUUID` function provided by the `edgedb-go` package. Here's how you can do it:\n```go\nid, err := edgedb.ParseUUID(\"2141a5b4-5634-4ccc-b835-437863534c51\")\nif err != nil {\n  log.Fatal(err)\n}\n// You can now use the `id` variable as a UUID in your application\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And if I want to execute a query, how would I do that?", "assistant": "To execute a query, you can use the `client.Query` or `client.QuerySingle` methods, depending on your needs. Here's a quick example of how to execute a query that retrieves multiple results:\n```go\nvar result []YourType // YourType should be a struct that matches the query result\nerr = client.Query(ctx, \"SELECT YourEntity FILTER .yourCondition = 'value'\", &result)\nif err != nil {\n  log.Fatal(err)\n}\n// Process your results stored in `result`\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to use EdgeDB with Rust, but I'm not sure how to set global variables for my queries. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In Rust, you can use the `with_globals_fn` method to set global variables for your EdgeDB client. Here's an example of how you can set a global variable named `current_user_id`:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me the code?", "assistant": "Sure, here's a snippet of Rust code that demonstrates how to set a global variable using the EdgeDB Rust client:\n```rust\nuse uuid::Uuid;\nuse edgedb_tokio::create_client;\nuse edgedb_protocol::value::Value;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let client = create_client().await.expect(\"Client init\");\n    let client_with_globals = client.with_globals_fn(|c| {\n        c.set(\n            \"current_user_id\",\n            Value::Uuid(\n                Uuid::parse_str(\"2141a5b4-5634-4ccc-b835-437863534c51\")\n                    .expect(\"Uuid should have parsed\"),\n            ),\n        )\n    });\n    // Now you can use `client_with_globals` for your queries\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so this sets the `current_user_id` to a specific UUID for all queries made with `client_with_globals`.

This can be particularly useful for session-based data like the current user's ID."}, {"human": "What if I need to change the `current_user_id` later on?", "assistant": "If you need to change the `current_user_id` or any other global variable, you can create a new client with the updated globals using the same `with_globals_fn` method. Just remember that the changes will only apply to the new client instance and not affect the existing ones."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about using EdgeDB with Rust or anything else, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to set a global variable in EdgeDB. Can you show me how to do that?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, you can set a global variable using the `SET GLOBAL` command in EdgeQL.

Here's the EdgeQL command you would use: ```edgeql SET GLOBAL current_user_id := '2141a5b4-5634-4ccc-b835-437863534c51'; ```"}, {"human": "What does this command do?", "assistant": "This command sets the global variable `current_user_id` to the specified UUID value. You can then use this global variable within your EdgeQL queries to reference the current user's ID."}, {"human": "Can I use any value for a global variable?", "assistant": "Global variables can hold different types of values, but it's important to use the correct type for the variable you're setting. In the example provided, we're assigning a UUID as a string value to `current_user_id`.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to define some global variables in my EdgeDB schema, but I'm not sure how to make them required. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can mark global variables as `required` by using the `required` keyword. When you do this, you also need to provide a default value for the variable. Here's an example of how you can define a required global variable with a default value:"}, {"human": "Could you show me an example of how to do that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's a simple example using SDL (Schema Definition Language): \n```sdl\nrequired global one_string: str {\n  default := \"Hi Mom!\";\n};\n``` \nIn this example, `one_string` is a global variable that is marked as required and has a default value of \"Hi Mom!\"."}, {"human": "Great, thanks! And what if I want to learn more about this?", "assistant": "You're welcome! To learn more about global variables and other features of EdgeDB, you can check out the official documentation. It has a wealth of information to help you get the most out of EdgeDB."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I heard that EdgeDB has something called computed globals. Can you tell me more about them?", "assistant": "Certainly! Computed globals in EdgeDB are global variables whose values are dynamically computed when they are referenced in queries. This means that instead of having a static value, a computed global's value is recalculated each time it's used in a query."}, {"human": "That sounds interesting. How would I define a computed global in my schema?", "assistant": "You can define a computed global in your schema using the SDL (Schema Definition Language). Here's an example where we define a computed global that returns the datetime of the transaction:\n```sdl\nrequired global random_global := datetime_of_transaction();\n```"}, {"human": "So, does this mean that every time I use 'random_global' in my queries, it will give me the transaction's datetime at that moment?", "assistant": "Exactly! The expression for the computed global is evaluated at the start of each query where 'random_global' is referenced. So, it will provide you with the datetime of the transaction at the moment the query began."}, {"human": "Is there anything special I need to do when querying a computed global?", "assistant": "No, there's nothing special you need to do. You can reference a computed global in your queries just like any other global. The only difference is that its value is computed at runtime, rather than being a fixed value."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use globals in my EdgeDB schema. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, globals are like variables that you can define at the database level and then reference throughout your schema. They are useful for storing values that you want to access in various parts of your schema, such as the current user's ID for access control purposes."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use a global in a schema declaration?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's a simple example where we define a `User` type and use a global to check if the user is the current user. First, you would define a global, and then you can reference it in your schema like this:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  name: str;\n  is_self := (.id = global current_user_id);\n};\n```"}, {"human": "I see. How would I use this in the context of access policies?", "assistant": "Access policies in EdgeDB allow you to define rules for who can access or modify data. You can use globals within these policies to create conditions based on the global value. Here's an example of an access policy that uses a global to ensure that only the person with the matching ID can access the data:\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  required name: str;\n  access policy my_policy allow all\n    using (.id = global current_user_id);\n};\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So the global `current_user_id` is used to compare against the `id` of the `Person`. If they match, the policy allows access.", "assistant": "Exactly! The `using` clause in the access policy checks if the condition is true. If the `id` of the `Person` is the same as the `current_user_id` global, then the policy allows the operation specified (in this case, 'allow all')."}, {"human": "Is there anything special I need to do to define a global?", "assistant": "To define a global, you use the `global` keyword followed by the name and type of the global. You also need to set an initial value. Here's how you could define the `current_user_id` global:\n```sdl\nglobal current_user_id -> uuid;\n```"}, {"human": "And how do I set or change the value of a global?", "assistant": "The value of a global can be set or changed using EdgeQL commands.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I've been working with EdgeDB and I heard it has a migration system. Can you tell me more about it?", "assistant": "Absolutely! EdgeDB has a built-in migration system that allows you to evolve your database schema over time without much hassle. When you want to make changes to your schema, you simply update your `.esdl` files with the new schema definitions."}, {"human": "Okay, I've made some changes to my `.esdl` file. What's the next step?", "assistant": "Once you've updated your `.esdl` file, you'll use the EdgeDB CLI to create and apply migrations. To create a migration, you would run the command `edgedb migration create` in your terminal. This command will generate a new migration file in the `dbschema/migrations` directory."}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I apply this migration to my database?", "assistant": "To apply the migration, you'll use the command `edgedb migrate`. This will apply the migration file that was created in the previous step to your database. Here's how the commands would look in your terminal:\n```bash\n$ edgedb migration create\nCreated dbschema/migrations/00001.esdl\n$ edgedb migrate\nApplied dbschema/migrations/00001.esdl.\n```"}, {"human": "That seems straightforward. Does the migration happen immediately?", "assistant": "Yes, when you run `edgedb migrate`, the migration is applied to your database immediately. Make sure to review your migration file before applying it to ensure that it accurately represents the changes you want to make to your schema."}, {"human": "What if I need to make more changes later on?", "assistant": "You can continue to evolve your schema by making changes to your `.esdl` files and repeating the migration process. Each time you create a migration, a new file is added to the `dbschema/migrations` directory, allowing you to track the history of your schema changes over time."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to organize my EdgeDB schema, and I heard something about modules. Can you explain what they are?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a schema consists of several modules, each with a unique name. Modules are a way to organize your schema into logical units, which can be especially helpful when dealing with large schemas."}, {"human": "So, how do I use these modules? Do I need to create multiple modules for my schema?", "assistant": "Most users put their entire schema inside a single module called `default`. However, if you want to organize your schema further, you can define additional modules. Here's how you would declare a module in SDL (Schema Definition Language): \n```sdl\nmodule default {\n  # declare types here\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. But what if I want to create a nested module? Is that possible?", "assistant": "The documentation snippet you provided doesn't include information on nested modules, but typically, modules are not nested. Each module is a separate namespace. If you need to create another module, you just declare it similarly to the `default` module, with a different name."}, {"human": "Alright, that makes sense. So, if I wanted to create a new module for my admin types, what would that look like?", "assistant": "To create a new module for your admin types, you would declare it like this: \n```sdl\nmodule admin {\n  # declare your admin types here\n}\n```"}, {"human": "And how do I reference types from a different module?", "assistant": "To reference types from a different module, you would use the module name as a prefix. For example, if you have a type `User` in the `admin` module and you want to reference it in the `default` module, you would use `admin::User`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to optimize my EdgeDB queries and I heard that indexing can help. Can you explain how that works?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can create indexes on properties to improve the performance of queries. When you index a property, the query planner can use that index to make filtering, ordering, or grouping by that property more efficient."}, {"human": "I see. How do I create an index on a property in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You can create an index using the Schema Definition Language (SDL). For example, if you have a `User` type with a `name` property, you can create an index on `name` like this:\n``sdl\ntype User {\n  required name: str;\n  index on (.name);\n}\n``\nThis tells EdgeDB to create an index on the `User.name` property."}, {"human": "Got it. So I just need to add that `index on` line under the property in my SDL?", "assistant": "Exactly! You place the `index on` line inside the type definition, and you use the dot notation shorthand `.name` to reference the property you want to index."}, {"human": "What does the dot notation shorthand mean?", "assistant": "The dot notation shorthand `.name` is a concise way to reference a property within the current type. In this case, `.name` refers to the `name` property of the `User` type. It's a simpler way of writing `User.name` when you're already within the context of the `User` type."}, {"human": "And this index will automatically be used for queries on the `name` property?", "assistant": "Yes, once you've created the index, the query planner can utilize it for queries that involve filtering, ordering, or grouping by the `name` property. This can lead to performance improvements for those queries."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to create an index on an expression in EdgeDB. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can define an index on a singleton expression, which is an expression that references multiple properties of the enclosing object type and is guaranteed to return at most one element. This means you cannot index on a `multi` property since it can return more than one element. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of how to create such an index.", "assistant": "Sure, here's an example of how you might define an index on a `User` type that combines the `first_name` and `last_name` properties into a single expression for the index:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required first_name -> str;\n  required last_name -> str;\n  index on (lower(first_name ++ ' ' ++ last_name));\n}\n```This index will allow for efficient queries on the full name in lowercase."}, {"human": "I see, so the expression inside the index is a singleton because it combines two properties into one string. What if I wanted to index on just the first name in lowercase?", "assistant": "If you want to index just the first name in lowercase, you would create an index on that specific expression like this:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required first_name -> str;\n  index on (lower(first_name));\n}\n```This index would be used to efficiently query users by their first name in lowercase."}, {"human": "Got it. And I can't use a `multi` property because it could return multiple elements, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! An index must be on a singleton expression, which means it should return at most one element. Since a `multi` property can contain several elements, it doesn't meet the criteria for a singleton expression and therefore cannot be indexed directly."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I've heard about composite indexes in databases. Can you tell me what a composite index is in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Sure! A composite index in EdgeDB is an index that references multiple properties. It's designed to speed up queries that filter, order, or group by both of those properties."}, {"human": "Interesting. Can you give me an example of how to create a composite index in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Certainly! Let's say you have a `User` type with `first_name` and `last_name` properties. You can create a composite index on these properties like this:\n```\nmodule default {\n    type User {\n        required first_name -> str;\n        required last_name -> str;\n\n        index on (first_name, last_name);\n    }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see. So this index would be used when I query for both first name and last name. But what if I only filter by `first_name`?", "assistant": "Good question! An index on multiple properties, like the one we created for `first_name` and `last_name`, may also be used in queries where only a single property in the index is filtered, ordered, or grouped by. It can still provide performance benefits in those cases."}, {"human": "Does that mean I should always create composite indexes for properties that I frequently query together?", "assistant": "It's generally a good idea to create composite indexes for properties that are often used together in queries. However, keep in mind that maintaining indexes comes with overhead, especially when writing data. You should balance the need for query performance with the cost of maintaining the index."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how indexing works in EdgeDB, especially for link properties. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can create indexes on link properties to improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by those properties. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of how to create an index on a link property.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's an example where we define an abstract link called 'friendship' with a property 'strength'. We then create an index on the 'strength' property of the 'friendship' link. ```sdl abstract link friendship {   strength: float64;   index on (__subject__@strength); }  type User {   multi friends: User {     extending friendship;   }; } ``` This index will help speed up queries that involve the 'strength' of friendships between users."}, {"human": "I see, so what does `__subject__` refer to in this context?", "assistant": "`__subject__` is a placeholder that refers to the source of the link in the context of the index. In this case, it refers to the 'User' instances that are the source of the 'friends' link. When you're indexing a property of a link, you use `__subject__` to indicate that you're indexing the property on the source side of the link."}, {"human": "Got it! And can I use this index in my queries directly?", "assistant": "The index itself is not used directly in your queries. Instead, it works behind the scenes to make your queries more efficient. When you perform a query that filters or sorts based on the 'strength' property of the 'friendship' link, EdgeDB will automatically use the index to speed up the operation."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I heard that EdgeDB allows you to specify Postgres index types. Can you tell me more about that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! EdgeDB exposes several Postgres index types that you can use in your schemas. These index types are available through the `pg` module in EdgeDB. Would you like to know about the specific types of indexes you can use?"}, {"human": "Yes, please. What types of indexes are available?", "assistant": "There are three main types of Postgres indexes that EdgeDB exposes: \n- `pg::hash`: This is an index based on a 32-bit hash derived from the indexed value. It's fast for equality searches. \n- `pg::btree`: This is a B-tree index that can be used to retrieve data in sorted order. It's good for range queries and sorting. \n- `pg::gin`: GIN stands for Generalized Inverted Index. It's an inverted index that's appropriate for indexing composite values like arrays or JSONB objects. \nEach of these index types is suited for different use cases."}, {"human": "Interesting. How would I go about using one of these indexes in my schema?", "assistant": "To use these indexes in your schema, you would define them using the SDL (Schema Definition Language) in EdgeDB. For example, if you wanted to create a B-tree index on a property of a type, you could write something like this in your SDL:\n``sdl\ntype User {\n  username: str;\n  index on (__subject__->username) using pg::btree;\n}\n``\nThis would create a B-tree index on the `username` property of the `User` type. The `__subject__` refers to the current instance of the type."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I want to use a GIN index?", "assistant": "If you want to use a GIN index, you would define it similarly, but specify `pg::gin` as the index type. Here's an example where we create a GIN index on a property that holds an array of strings:\n``sdl\ntype Article {\n  tags: array<str>;\n  index on (__subject__->tags) using pg::gin;\n}\n``\nThis index would be useful for queries that involve searching for articles based on the tags they include."}, {"human": "Makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB, indexes, or anything else, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use annotations with indexes in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can annotate an index to provide additional information about it. This can be useful for documentation purposes or to convey the intent behind the index. Here's an example of how you can annotate an index in the schema definition language (SDL):"}, {"human": "Could you show me an example?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you would define an index on the 'name' field of a 'User' type and add an annotation to it:"}, {"human": "Okay, let me see the code.", "assistant": "```sdl\ntype User {\n  name: str;\n  index on (.name) {\n    annotation description := 'Indexing all users by name.';\n  };\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so the annotation is just a description for the index?", "assistant": "Exactly! The annotation 'description' is used here to explain the purpose of the index. It's a way to document that this particular index is used for indexing all users by their name."}, {"human": "Is this the same as indexing primary keys and foreign keys in SQL?", "assistant": "It's important to note that while SQL databases commonly use indexes to index primary keys and foreign keys, EdgeDB automatically indexes properties that are part of a link or property constraint, like `unique` or `required`. So you don't need to manually create indexes for these cases. However, you can still create additional indexes for other purposes, like optimizing query performance for specific access patterns."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the clarification!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how inheritance works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, object types can extend other object types. This means that the extending type, also known as the subtype, inherits all the links, properties, indexes, constraints, and so on from its supertypes. Would you like to see a simple example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say we have an abstract object type called `Animal` with a single property `species`. Then, we create another object type called `Dog` that extends `Animal` and adds an additional property `breed`. Here's how it would look in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype Animal {\n  species: str;\n}\n\ntype Dog extending Animal {\n  breed: str;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `Dog` is a subtype of `Animal` and inherits the `species` property from it. So instances of `Dog` will have both `species` and `breed` properties."}, {"human": "I see. So can only abstract types be extended, or can concrete types be extended as well?", "assistant": "Both abstract and concrete object types can be extended in EdgeDB. An abstract type is like a template that can't be instantiated on its own, while a concrete type can be instantiated. When you extend either of them, the subtype inherits all the characteristics of the supertype."}, {"human": "Got it. Can a subtype override something it inherits from the supertype?", "assistant": "Yes, a subtype can override certain aspects of what it inherits from the supertype, such as default values or constraints. However, it must still conform to the overall structure and rules defined by the supertype. For example, if the supertype has a required property, the subtype cannot make it optional."}, {"human": "Makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how multiple inheritance works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, an object type can extend more than one other type, and this is known as multiple inheritance. This allows you to build complex object types by combining more basic ones. For example, you might have two abstract types, one that includes a name and another that includes an email. Then you can create a new type that inherits properties from both."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to define types with multiple inheritance?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have two abstract types: `HasName` and `HasEmail`. Here's how you would define them and a `Person` type that extends both:\n```sdl\ntype HasName {\n  first_name -> str;\n  last_name -> str;\n}\n\ntype HasEmail {\n  email -> str;\n}\n\ntype Person extending HasName, HasEmail {\n  # Person inherits first_name, last_name, and email\n  # You can also add more properties or links specific to Person here\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. And how would I use this in a query?", "assistant": "In a query, you can treat the `Person` type just like any other object type. Since it inherits properties from `HasName` and `HasEmail`, you can select these properties directly. Here's an example EdgeQL query that selects a person's name and email:\n```edgeql\nSELECT Person {\n  first_name,\n  last_name,\n  email\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. And if I wanted to add a new property to the Person type, how would I do that?", "assistant": "To add a new property to the `Person` type, you simply define it within the type's body. For instance, if you want to add a `birthdate` property, you would update the `Person` type like this:\n```sdl\ntype Person extending HasName, HasEmail {\n  birthdate -> datetime;\n}\n```Now, `Person` has `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `birthdate` properties."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if there's a conflict between the properties of the types I'm extending?", "assistant": "In the case of a conflict, where multiple inherited types define a property with the same name, EdgeDB will require you to resolve the conflict explicitly in the subtype. You would do this by redefining the property in the subtype and specifying which inherited type's property you want to use, or by providing a new definition."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about the concept of overloading in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, overloading allows an object type to redefine an inherited property or link. This means that if you have a type that inherits from another, you can specify a new definition for an existing property or link. However, to do this, you must prefix the new definition with the `overloaded` keyword. This is to ensure that you don't accidentally redefine something you didn't intend to."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to overload a property in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have an abstract type called `Person` with a `name` property and a `friends` link. If you want to create a `Student` type that inherits from `Person` but you want to make the `name` property unique for each `Student`, you would overload it like this:\n```sdl\nabstract type Person {\n  name: str;\n  multi friends: Person;\n}\n\ntype Student extending Person {\n  overloaded name: str {\n    constraint exclusive;\n  }\n  // ... other properties or links for Student\n}\n```In this example, the `Student` type has an `overloaded` `name` property with an `exclusive` constraint, ensuring that each `Student` has a unique name."}, {"human": "What happens if I don't use the `overloaded` keyword?", "assistant": "If you don't use the `overloaded` keyword when redefining an inherited property or link, EdgeDB will raise an error. This is a safety feature to prevent unintentional overloading. It ensures that you are making a conscious decision to redefine an inherited attribute and that you are aware of the implications of doing so."}, {"human": "Is there anything else I should know about overloading?", "assistant": "Just remember that overloading is a powerful feature that should be used with care. It allows you to customize inherited properties and links to fit the needs of your derived types, but it also introduces complexity. Make sure that the overloading is necessary for your design and that it doesn't introduce confusion or unexpected behavior in your schema."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what abstract properties are in EdgeDB. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, abstract properties are properties that are declared without being directly associated with a specific type. They are like templates that you can reuse in different types. You can also add annotations to them and mark them as `readonly` if you want them to be immutable."}, {"human": "I see. Can you show me an example of how to define an abstract property?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's an example of how you can define an abstract property called `title_prop` with an annotation and without making it readonly:\n```sdl\nabstract title_prop {\n  annotation title := 'A title.';\n  readonly := false;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how would I use this abstract property in a type?", "assistant": "To use an abstract property in a type, you would extend the type with the abstract property. Here's an example where we create a type `Movie` that uses the `title_prop` abstract property:\n```sdl\ntype Movie extending title_prop {\n  # other properties and links specific to Movie\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. So, I can use `title_prop` in multiple types if I want to?", "assistant": "Exactly! You can reuse `title_prop` in as many types as you need. This helps keep your schema DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and consistent across different types that share similar properties."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand what abstract links are in EdgeDB. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, an abstract link is a link that isn't directly tied to a specific source or target type. It's a way to define a common structure for links that can be reused across different types in your schema. You can think of it as a template for creating actual links later on."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of an abstract link?", "assistant": "Sure, here's an example of an abstract link called `link_with_strength` which includes a property `strength` and an index on that property. This abstract link can be used by other types to create concrete links with a `strength` attribute.\n``sdl\nabstract link link_with_strength {\n  strength: float64;\n  index on (__subject__@strength);\n}\n``"}, {"human": "How would I use this abstract link in a type?", "assistant": "To use the abstract link in a type, you would define a concrete link in that type and inherit from the abstract link. For instance, if you have a `Person` type and you want to create a `friends` link that uses the `link_with_strength`, you would do it like this:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  multi friends: link_with_strength -> Person;\n}\n``This means that `friends` is a multi-link to other `Person` instances and it includes the `strength` property from the `link_with_strength` abstract link."}, {"human": "What does the index on `__subject__@strength` do?", "assistant": "The index on `__subject__@strength` is a way to optimize queries that filter or sort by the `strength` property of the link. In this context, `__subject__` refers to the source of the link. By indexing the `strength` property, the database can more efficiently retrieve and order records based on the strength of the link."}, {"human": "Can abstract links be readonly or have annotations?", "assistant": "Yes, abstract links can be marked as readonly, which means that once a link is created, it cannot be modified. They can also contain annotations, which are notes or metadata that you can attach to the link definition. Annotations don't affect the behavior of the database but can be useful for documentation or code generation purposes."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use constraints in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, constraints are used to define rules that the data must satisfy. You can declare reusable, user-defined constraint types using the `abstract` keyword. These constraints can then be applied to properties within your types. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Alright, here's an example of a custom constraint called `in_range` that ensures a value is within a specified range. First, we declare the constraint using `abstract`:\n```sdl\nabstract constraint in_range(min: anyreal, max: anyreal) {\n  errmessage := 'Value must be in range [{min}, {max}].';\n  using (min <= __subject__ and __subject__ < max);\n}\n```\nThen, we can apply this constraint to a property in a type. For instance, we can ensure that a `Player` type has `points` that are between 0 and 100:\n```sdl\ntype Player {\n  points: int64 {\n    constraint in_range(0, 100);\n  }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What does `__subject__` refer to in the constraint?", "assistant": "`__subject__` is a placeholder that refers to the value being constrained. In the context of our `in_range` constraint, `__subject__` represents the value of the property to which the constraint is applied. The `using` clause defines the condition that must be met, which in this case is that the value must be greater than or equal to `min` and less than `max`."}, {"human": "Can I use this constraint on multiple properties or types?", "assistant": "Yes, absolutely! Since `in_range` is an abstract constraint, you can reuse it on any property of a compatible type, such as `int64` or any other `anyreal` type. You just need to apply the constraint to the property and specify the minimum and maximum values you want to enforce."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or constraints, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how annotations work in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, annotations are a way to attach metadata to schema objects like types, functions, and more. There are three built-in annotation types: `title`, `description`, and `deprecated`. You can also create custom annotations using `abstract annotation`. Would you like to see an example of how to define and use a custom annotation?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of a custom annotation.", "assistant": "Alright, here's how you can define a custom annotation called `admin_note` in SDL (Schema Definition Language): \n```sdl\nabstract annotation admin_note;\n\ntype Status {\n  annotation admin_note := 'system-critical';\n  # more properties\n}\n``` \nIn this example, we've created an annotation `admin_note` and used it to mark the `Status` type with a note saying 'system-critical'. You can add more properties to the `Status` type as needed."}, {"human": "I see. And how do I use this annotation in a query?", "assistant": "Annotations are primarily for providing metadata in the schema, so they aren't directly used in queries like SELECT or INSERT. However, you can access them through schema reflection queries if you need to retrieve the metadata. For example, you can get the `admin_note` for all types in your schema with a query like this: \n```edgeql\nSELECT schema::Type {\n  name,\n  annotations: {\n    @admin_note\n  }\n}\n``` \nThis will return the names of the types and their associated `admin_note` annotations, if any."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I want to change the annotation later on?", "assistant": "To change an annotation, you would update the schema using SDL or DDL (Data Definition Language). Here's how you could change the `admin_note` annotation for the `Status` type using SDL: \n```sdl\ntype Status {\n  annotation admin_note := 'updated-note';\n}\n``` \nThis will update the `admin_note` to 'updated-note'. Remember to apply the schema changes for them to take effect."}, {"human": "Thanks! And what does it mean when an annotation is marked as `deprecated`?", "assistant": "The `deprecated` annotation is a special built-in annotation that you can use to mark schema objects as deprecated. This is useful for indicating that an object should no longer be used and may be removed in a future version of the schema. Here's an example of how to use it: \n```sdl\ntype OldType {\n  annotation deprecated := 'This type will be removed in the next release.';\n}\n``` \nWhen someone looks at the schema definition, they'll see that `OldType` is marked as deprecated with a note explaining the reason."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hi there, I'm trying to understand what type casts are in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a type cast is an operation that converts a value of one data type into another. You can introspect type casts in the schema by querying the `schema::Cast` type. This can give you information about the casts available in the database, including details like whether a cast is implicit or explicit."}, {"human": "Interesting. How can I see all the available casts in my database?", "assistant": "You can see all the available casts by running an EdgeQL query that selects from `schema::Cast`. Here's an example of how you might write such a query: \n```edgeql\nwith module schema\nselect Cast {\n    from_type -> name,\n    to_type -> name,\n    allowed,\n    implicit\n};\n``` \nThis query will show you the types involved in the cast, whether the cast is allowed, and if it's implicit."}, {"human": "What does it mean for a cast to be implicit?", "assistant": "An implicit cast is one that the database can perform automatically without needing explicit instruction. For example, casting from an integer to a float can typically be done implicitly because there's no loss of information. On the other hand, explicit casts require you to specify the cast using a casting operator because they might involve potential loss of information or precision, like casting a float to an integer."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me how to check if a specific cast, say from `int16` to `str`, is implicit?", "assistant": "Sure! You can modify the previous query to filter for the specific cast you're interested in. Here's how you could do that: \n```edgeql\nwith module schema\nselect Cast {\n    from_type -> name,\n    to_type -> name,\n    allowed,\n    implicit\n}\nfilter (\n    .from_type -> name = 'std::int16' and\n    .to_type -> name = 'std::str'\n);\n``` \nThis query will return information about the cast from `int16` to `str`, including whether it's implicit."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! Can I also find out what links or properties are associated with `schema::Cast`?", "assistant": "Yes, you can. The `schema::Cast` type has links and properties that you can introspect. To see them, you can extend the query like this: \n```edgeql\nwith module schema\nselect Cast {\n    from_type -> name,\n    to_type -> name,\n    allowed,\n    implicit,\n    links: {\n        name\n    },\n    properties: {\n        name\n    }\n};\n``` \nThis will give you the names of the links and properties associated with each cast in the schema."}]}

Since `schema::Array` is a built-in type, the result will show the structure of arrays as defined in the EdgeDB schema."}, {"human": "Can I use this to introspect other types as well?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can replace 'schema::Array' with any other type name in your schema to introspect that type. Just make sure to use the correct type name in the filter clause. For example, if you have a custom type called 'User', you would use `filter .name = 'User';` to introspect it."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

You can use a similar query to introspect any object type in the schema. Just replace 'schema::Tuple' with the name of the type you're interested in. For example, if you want to introspect a type named 'User', you would use the following query:\n```edgeql\nwith module schema\nselect ObjectType {\n    name,\n    links: {\n        name\n    },\n    properties: {\n        name\n    }\n}\nfilter .name = 'User';\n```\nThis will give you information about the 'User' type in your schema."}]}

Links are directional. They have a source, which is the object type on which they are declared, and a target, which is the type they point to. In our example, the source is `Person`, and the target is also `Person`, indicating that a `Person` can have a `best_friend` who is also a `Person`."}, {"human": "What if I want to make it clear that a person can have only one best friend?", "assistant": "The way the link is defined in the example already implies that a `Person` can have only one `best_friend`, because it's a single link.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to filter and order the data I get from a link in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can use the `filter`, `order by`, and `limit` clauses on links just like you would with regular queries. These clauses can be included directly in the shape of the link. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example using a 'User' type with a 'likes' link.", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you can order the 'likes' link of a 'User' type by the title of the liked items in descending order and limit the results to 10 items: \n```edgeql\nselect User {\n  likes order by .title desc limit 10\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to filter the 'likes' as well?", "assistant": "To filter the 'likes' link, you can add a `filter` clause before the `order by`. For example, if you want to select users and their likes that have a title containing the word 'EdgeDB', you would write: \n```edgeql\nselect User {\n  likes filter .title ilike '%EdgeDB%' order by .title desc limit 10\n};\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I only want to select the titles of the likes, not the whole object?", "assistant": "If you want to select only specific properties of the linked items, you can specify them in the shape.

One more thing, can I apply multiple filters or sort by multiple properties?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can chain multiple `filter` clauses using `and` or `or`, and you can sort by multiple properties by listing them in the `order by` clause.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how default values work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, both properties and links can have default values. These default values are defined using EdgeQL expressions that are executed when a new record is inserted into the database. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example with links.", "assistant": "Alright, here's an example where we define a type `Person` with a `name` and a `friends` link. Each new person will be automatically assigned three random friends upon creation. Here's how it looks in SDL:\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  required name: str;\n  multi friends: Person {\n    default := (select Person order by random() limit 3);\n  }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "So, when I insert a new person without specifying friends, EdgeDB will automatically assign three friends to them?", "assistant": "Exactly! If you don't explicitly set the `friends` link when inserting a new `Person`, EdgeDB will execute the default EdgeQL expression to select three random existing people from the database and set them as the friends of the new person."}, {"human": "What happens if there are less than three people in the database when I insert a new person?", "assistant": "If there are fewer than three people available in the database, the default EdgeQL expression will simply select as many people as are available. So, if there's only one or two people, the new person will have one or two friends, respectively."}, {"human": "Got it. And can I override this default value when I insert a person?", "assistant": "Yes, you can. When you insert a new `Person`, you can specify the `friends` link explicitly with the friends you want to assign. When you do this, the default value expression is not used, and your specified value takes precedence."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand link properties in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are with an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! Link properties in EdgeDB are additional pieces of information that you can attach to a link between two objects. They're used to store metadata about the relationship itself. For instance, if you have a link representing family members, you might want to store the nature of the relationship, like whether the person is a parent, sibling, or child. Here's a simple example using SDL (Schema Definition Language): \n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  name: str;\n  multi family_members: Person {\n    relationship: str;\n  }\n}\n``` \nIn this schema, we have a `Person` type with a `name` property. We also define a link `family_members` which is a multi link (meaning a person can have multiple family members). The `relationship` property on this link can be used to store the nature of the family relationship, such as 'parent', 'sibling', etc."}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So the 'relationship' is a property of the 'family_members' link. Can link properties be of any data type?", "assistant": "Yes, link properties can be of any data type that EdgeDB supports for regular properties. This includes basic types like `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex types like arrays or even other object types. However, it's important to use appropriate data types that make sense for the metadata you're trying to represent. In the previous example, `relationship` is a string because it represents a descriptive label of the relationship."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me how to query this link property in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "Sure! To query a link property, you use a slightly different syntax in EdgeQL to access the property of the link. Here's an example query that retrieves all persons along with their family members and the type of relationship they have: \n```edgeql\nSELECT Person {\n  name,\n  family_members: {\n    @relationship,\n    name\n  }\n}\n``` \nIn this query, `@relationship` is used to access the `relationship` link property. The result will include each person's name and a set of their family members' names along with the relationship type."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! And what if I want to filter family members based on the relationship, say, get only the siblings?", "assistant": "To filter based on a link property, you can use a `FILTER` clause in your EdgeQL query. Here's how you can modify the previous query to get only the siblings: \n```edgeql\nSELECT Person {\n  name,\n  family_members: {\n    @relationship,\n    name\n  }\nFILTER Person.family_members@relationship = 'sibling'\n}\n``` \nThis query will return each person's name and a set of names of their siblings only, as it filters the family members to include only those where the `relationship` link property equals 'sibling'."}]}

The `@relationship` is the link property on the `family_members` link."}, {"human": "I see, but what if I want to update the relationship later on?", "assistant": "To update a link property, you would use the `update` statement. Here's how you can update the `relationship` link property for Bob's family member Alice to 'cousin':\n```edgeql\nupdate Person\nfilter .name = \"Bob\"\nset {\n  family_members := (\n    select .family_members filter .name = \"Alice\" {\n      @relationship := \"cousin\"\n    }\n  )\n}\n```This statement finds the person named Bob, then within his `family_members`, it finds Alice and updates the `relationship` link property to 'cousin'."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And what if there are multiple family members and I only want to update one of them?", "assistant": "In that case, you would still use the `update` statement, but you would apply a more specific filter to select only the family member you want to update. For example, if Bob has two family members, Alice and Charlie, and you only want to update the relationship for Alice, you would do the following:\n```edgeql\nupdate Person\nfilter .name = \"Bob\"\nset {\n  family_members := (\n    select .family_members filter .name = \"Alice\" {\n      @relationship := \"cousin\"\n    }\n  )\n}\n```This ensures that only the link property for Alice is updated, and Charlie's link property remains unchanged."}, {"human": "Makes sense.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what 'target deletion' means in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, 'target deletion' refers to the policies that determine what action should be taken when the target of a link is deleted. For example, if you have a link between two types and you delete the target object, the policy will dictate whether the source object should also be deleted, or if some other action should be taken."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to define such a policy?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you have a `MessageThread` type and a `Message` type, where each `Message` is linked to a `MessageThread`. You can define a policy that will delete the `Message` if its associated `MessageThread` is deleted.

You can create a polymorphic link to `Person`, which allows you to associate both `Hero` and `Villain` instances with a `ComicBook`. Here's how you might define that:\n```sdl\ntype ComicBook {\n  title: str;\n  characters: multi Person;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So the `characters` link can refer to any type that extends `Person`?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `characters` link is polymorphic, meaning it can point to instances of `Hero`, `Villain`, or any other type that extends `Person`.

You can then use this abstract link in other link definitions to inherit the 'strength' property."}, {"human": "How would I use this abstract link in a real link definition?", "assistant": "To use the abstract link in a real link definition, you would extend the abstract link. Here's an example:\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  # ... other properties and links ...\n}\n\ntype Monster {\n  # ... other properties and links ...\n}\n\ntype Battle {\n  fought_by: link_with_strength extending (Person, Monster);\n}\n```In this example, the 'Battle' type has a link called 'fought_by' that extends the 'link_with_strength' abstract link. This means 'fought_by' will inherit the 'strength' property and will link 'Person' to 'Monster'."}, {"human": "What if I want to add more properties to the 'fought_by' link?", "assistant": "You can add more properties to the 'fought_by' link by defining them within the link's body. Here's how you could add a 'date' property to the 'fought_by' link:\n```sdl\ntype Battle {\n  fought_by: link_with_strength extending (Person, Monster) {\n    date: datetime;\n  };\n}\n```Now, the 'fought_by' link has both the inherited 'strength' property from the abstract link and a new 'date' property specific to the 'Battle' type."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand link cardinality in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, every link between types has a cardinality, which can be either `single` or `multi`. A `single` cardinality means it's a 'to-one' link, which is the default. If you want to create a 'to-many' link, you use the `multi` keyword. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you would define a type `Person` with a `multi` link to represent friends, which is a 'to-many' relationship:\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  multi friends: Person;\n}\n```This means that a `Person` can have multiple friends, and each friend is also a `Person`."}, {"human": "Got it. And what about backlinks?", "assistant": "Backlinks are used to find objects that link to a specific object. Since they represent the reverse direction of a link, they inherently assume a `multi` cardinality. This is because there could be multiple objects linking to the same target object."}, {"human": "Makes sense. So I don't need to specify `multi` for backlinks?", "assistant": "Exactly, you don't need to specify `multi` for backlinks because it's already assumed that there could be many objects linking back to one object."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to define required links in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, links can be either optional or required. By default, links are optional. If you want to make a link required, you use the 'required' keyword in your schema definition. A required link must point to at least one target instance. If the link's cardinality is 'single', it must point to exactly one target instance. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of a required link.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say we have a type 'Person' and a type 'Passport'. We want to ensure that every 'Person' has exactly one 'Passport'. Here's how you could define that in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  required passport: Passport;\n}\n\ntype Passport {\n  # ... other properties and links ...\n}\n``\nIn this example, the 'passport' link is required, meaning every 'Person' instance must have one and only one 'Passport' associated with it."}, {"human": "What if a Person can have multiple passports? How would I define that?", "assistant": "If a 'Person' can have multiple passports, you would define the link as 'multi'. Here's how you can adjust the SDL to allow for multiple passports:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  required multi passports: Passport;\n}\n\ntype Passport {\n  # ... other properties and links ...\n}\n``\nWith 'required multi passports', each 'Person' must have at least one 'Passport', but can have more than one."}, {"human": "Got it! And what happens if I try to create a Person without a passport?", "assistant": "If you try to create a 'Person' instance without assigning a 'Passport' to the required 'passport' link, EdgeDB will raise an error. The operation will be rejected because it violates the schema's requirement that every 'Person' must have a 'Passport'. You need to ensure that when you create a 'Person', you also provide the associated 'Passport' data."}, {"human": "Makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what an 'exclusive' constraint does in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! An 'exclusive' constraint in EdgeDB ensures that a particular link or property is unique across all instances of an object. In other words, it guarantees that no two objects can have the same value for the property or link that has the 'exclusive' constraint."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how that would work with a link?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's consider a social media application where you have a `GroupChat` type and a `Person` type. If you want to ensure that a person can only be a member of one group chat at a time, you can add an `exclusive` constraint to the `members` link in the `GroupChat` type. Here's how you would define it in SDL:\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  name: str;\n}\n\ntype GroupChat {\n  required multi members: Person {\n    constraint exclusive;\n  }\n}\n```In this example, the `members` link of `GroupChat` is now `exclusive`, meaning that once a `Person` is added to a `GroupChat`, they cannot be added to another `GroupChat`."}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So if I try to add a person to two different group chats, what will happen?", "assistant": "If you try to add a person to two different group chats, EdgeDB will raise a constraint violation error because the `exclusive` constraint on the `members` link prevents a `Person` from being associated with more than one `GroupChat`. You'll need to ensure that each person is only a member of one group chat at a time to comply with the constraint."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And this works the same way for properties too?", "assistant": "Yes, exactly! The `exclusive` constraint can also be applied to properties. For example, if you have a `User` type with an `email` property, you can make sure that each user has a unique email address by adding an `exclusive` constraint to the `email` property. Here's how it would look:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required email: str {\n    constraint exclusive;\n  }\n}\n```With this constraint in place, no two `User` instances can have the same `email` value."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand many-to-one relationships in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me with an example?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, a many-to-one relationship is used to represent concepts like ownership, membership, or hierarchies. For instance, let's consider the relationship between `Person` and `Shirt`. One person can own many shirts, but each shirt is typically owned by just one person. Here's how you might define this in SDL:"}, {"human": "Okay, I see. Can you show me the SDL definition for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the SDL definition for the `Person` and `Shirt` types, showcasing a many-to-one relationship where `Shirt` has an `owner` link to `Person`:\n```\nsdl\ntype Person {\n  required name: str;\n}\n\ntype Shirt {\n  required color: str;\n  owner: Person;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So, the 'owner' field in the Shirt type points to a Person, indicating that each Shirt is owned by a single Person. Is that correct?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `owner` field in the `Shirt` type is a link to a `Person`. This establishes a many-to-one relationship, where each `Shirt` instance is associated with one `Person` instance, indicating ownership."}, {"human": "What if I wanted to query all shirts owned by a specific person? How would I do that in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "You can query all shirts owned by a specific person using EdgeQL like this:\n```\nSELECT Shirt {\n  color,\n  owner: {\n    name\n  }\n}\nFILTER .owner.name = 'John Doe';\n```This query selects all `Shirt` instances with their `color` and the `name` of their `owner`, but only includes shirts where the owner's name is 'John Doe'."}, {"human": "That makes sense. And how would I add a new Shirt to the database for a specific person?", "assistant": "To add a new `Shirt` to the database for a specific person, you would first need the `id` of the `Person` instance. Then you can use an EdgeQL INSERT statement like this:\n```\nINSERT Shirt {\n  color := 'Blue',\n  owner := (SELECT Person FILTER .name = 'John Doe')\n};\n```This statement creates a new `Shirt` with the color 'Blue' and sets its `owner` to the `Person` instance whose name is 'John Doe'."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand one-to-many relationships in EdgeDB. Can you explain how that works?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a one-to-many relationship means that one entity can be associated with multiple instances of another entity. For example, a single person can own multiple shirts. The 'directionality' of the relationship is just a matter of perspective. Would you like to see how this is represented in the schema?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of how to define a one-to-many relationship in the schema.", "assistant": "Sure, here's an example using the Schema Definition Language (SDL) to define a one-to-many relationship between `Person` and `Shirt` where a `Person` can own multiple `Shirts`:\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  required name: str;\n  multi shirts: Shirt;\n}\n\ntype Shirt {\n  # Shirt details go here\n}\n```In this schema, the `multi` keyword indicates that the `shirts` link can refer to multiple `Shirt` instances, creating a one-to-many relationship from `Person` to `Shirt`."}, {"human": "What if I want to ensure that each shirt is owned by only one person?", "assistant": "To ensure that each `Shirt` is owned by only one `Person`, you can use the `constraint exclusive` on the reverse link in the `Shirt` type. Here's how you can modify the `Shirt` type to include this constraint:\n```sdl\ntype Shirt {\n  # Other Shirt properties\n  owner: Person {\n    constraint exclusive;\n  }\n}\n```This `exclusive` constraint ensures that each `Shirt` instance can be linked to at most one `Person` instance, maintaining the one-to-many relationship integrity."}, {"human": "Great, thanks! And how do I query this relationship using EdgeQL?", "assistant": "To query this relationship, you can use EdgeQL, which is EdgeDB's query language. For example, if you want to find all shirts owned by a person named 'Alice', you could write the following query:\n```edgeql\nSELECT Person {\n  name,\n  shirts {\n    # attributes of Shirt you want to select\n  }\n}\nFILTER .name = 'Alice';\n```This query selects the `Person` instances with the name 'Alice' and includes the `shirts` they own in the output."}]}

Can you help me understand how to represent a one-to-one relationship in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to help with that! In EdgeDB, a one-to-one relationship means that one instance of a source type is linked to a single instance of a target type, and vice versa. For your parking lot management system, you might have employees and parking spaces, where each employee is assigned exactly one parking space, and each parking space is assigned to exactly one employee. Here's how you could define that in EdgeDB's Schema Definition Language (SDL): \n```sdl\ntype Employee {\n  required name: str;\n  assigned_space: ParkingSpace {\n    constraint exclusive;\n  }\n}\n\ntype ParkingSpace {\n  required number: str;\n  // ... other properties ...\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so what does the 'constraint exclusive' part mean?", "assistant": "The 'constraint exclusive' clause is used to ensure that the relationship is indeed one-to-one. It means that each `ParkingSpace` can be assigned to at most one `Employee`. This prevents situations where two employees might be assigned the same parking space. It's a way to enforce uniqueness in the relationship."}, {"human": "Got it. And how would I go about linking an employee to a parking space in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "To link an `Employee` to a `ParkingSpace`, you would insert the data for both types and create the link between them. Here's an example of how you might do that using EdgeQL, EdgeDB's query language:\n```edgedb\nINSERT Employee {\n  name := 'Alice',\n  assigned_space := (INSERT ParkingSpace {\n    number := 'A1'\n  })\n};\n```\nThis query creates a new `Employee` named Alice and simultaneously creates a new `ParkingSpace` with the number 'A1', then links them together through the `assigned_space` property."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! And if I wanted to update the assigned parking space for an employee, how would I do that?", "assistant": "To update the assigned parking space for an employee, you would use an EdgeQL update command. Here's an example that changes the assigned parking space for an employee named Alice to a different parking space with the number 'B2':\n```edgedb\nUPDATE Employee\nSET {\n  assigned_space := (SELECT ParkingSpace\n                     FILTER .number = 'B2')\n}\nFILTER .name = 'Alice';\n```\nThis command finds the `ParkingSpace` with the number 'B2' and sets it as the new `assigned_space` for the `Employee` named Alice."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand many-to-many relationships in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me with an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a many-to-many relationship means that there are no exclusivity or cardinality constraints in either direction between two entities. For instance, let's consider a scenario where users can 'like' multiple movies, and movies can be 'liked' by multiple users. Here's how you might define this in SDL:"}, {"human": "Okay, I'm following. Could you show me the SDL definition for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's a simple SDL definition for a `User` type and a `Movie` type, with a many-to-many relationship between them:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required name: str;\n  multi likes: Movie;\n}\n\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  # ... other properties or links ...\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So 'multi' indicates that a user can like multiple movies?", "assistant": "Exactly! The 'multi' keyword specifies that the 'likes' link can reference multiple `Movie` instances. Similarly, since there's no constraint on the `Movie` side, a `Movie` can be liked by multiple `User` instances."}, {"human": "What if I want to add more information about the 'like', such as when the user liked the movie?", "assistant": "In that case, you would create an intermediate type to represent the 'like' itself, which can hold additional information. Here's an example:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required name: str;\n  multi likes: Like;\n}\n\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi liked_by: Like;\n}\n\ntype Like {\n  required user: User;\n  required movie: Movie;\n  required liked_at: datetime;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So the 'Like' type acts as a junction table that holds the relationship and the timestamp. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! That's correct, the 'Like' type serves as a link table that not only connects `User` and `Movie`, but also stores additional data about the relationship, such as the timestamp. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand rewrite rules in EdgeDB. Can you explain what special variables I have access to within the rule's expression?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, when you're working with rewrite rules, you have access to two special variables inside the rule's expression. The first one is `__subject__`, which refers to the object type that is being modified, including the new property and link values. The second one is `__specified__`, which is a named tuple. Each key in this tuple corresponds to a property or link in the type, and the value is a boolean indicating whether this value was explicitly set in the mutation operation."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use these variables in a rewrite rule?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a type `User` with a `last_modified` property that you want to automatically update to the current timestamp whenever the user is modified. Here's how you might write a rewrite rule using the `__subject__` and `__specified__` variables:\n```\nmodule default {\n  type User {\n    required username: str;\n    last_modified: datetime;\n    rewrite on update {\n      set last_modified := datetime_current();\n      unless __specified__->last_modified;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this rule, `datetime_current()` is a function that returns the current timestamp. The `unless` clause checks if `last_modified` was explicitly specified in the update operation using `__specified__->last_modified`. If it wasn't, the `last_modified` property is set to the current timestamp."}, {"human": "What happens if `last_modified` is specified in the update operation?", "assistant": "If `last_modified` is explicitly specified in the update operation, the `unless` clause in the rewrite rule will evaluate to true, and the rule will not update the `last_modified` property. This allows you to override the automatic timestamp update if needed. So, if you provide a specific `last_modified` value when updating a `User`, that value will be used instead of the current timestamp."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what mutation rewrites are in EdgeDB. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! Mutation rewrites in EdgeDB are a way to automatically set the value of a property during insert and update mutations. This is particularly useful for creating cached computed values. For example, you might want to store the result of a computation at the time of insertion so that you don't have to compute it every time you access the data."}, {"human": "That sounds useful. Do you have an example of how that would work in a schema?", "assistant": "Sure, let's consider a `Post` type in an EdgeDB schema. Suppose we want to automatically set the `created` property to the current datetime when a new post is created, and we also want to have a `byline` property that combines the author's name and the post's title. Here's how you could define that:"}, {"human": "Okay, show me the code for that.", "assistant": "Here's the SDL for the `Post` type with the mutation rewrites:\n\n```sdl\ntype Post {\n  required title: str;\n  required body: str;\n  author: str;\n  created: datetime {\n    rewrite insert using (datetime_of_statement())\n  }\n  # The byline property would be defined here with its own rewrite logic\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `created` property is set using `rewrite insert` which calls the `datetime_of_statement()` function to get the current datetime when a new `Post` is inserted. The `byline` property would be defined similarly with its own logic to combine the author's name and the post's title."}, {"human": "I see, but the `byline` property isn't fully defined here. How would I complete that?", "assistant": "The `byline` property would be defined with a rewrite rule that concatenates the author's name and the post's title. Unfortunately, the provided documentation snippet doesn't include the full definition for the `byline` property. However, I can show you a hypothetical example of how it might look:\n\n```sdl\ntype Post {\n  required title: str;\n  required body: str;\n  author: str;\n  created: datetime {\n    rewrite insert using (datetime_of_statement())\n  }\n  byline: str {\n    rewrite insert using (author ++ ' - ' ++ title)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this hypothetical example, the `byline` property uses the `rewrite insert` clause to set its value to a concatenation of the `author` and `title` properties, separated by a hyphen, when a new `Post` is inserted."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And this `byline` will be stored in the database, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `byline` will be stored in the database as a regular property of the `Post` type. Because its value is set during insertion using a mutation rewrite, it acts as a cached computed value. This means that the computation is done once at insertion time, and the result is stored and retrieved without needing to recompute it each time it's accessed."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what object types are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! Object types in EdgeDB are the primary components of an EdgeDB schema. They're similar to tables in SQL or models in an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system. Object types consist of properties and links which define the structure of your data."}, {"human": "What exactly are properties and links?", "assistant": "Properties are used to attach primitive data, like strings or numbers, to an object type. Links, on the other hand, are used to establish relationships between different object types, similar to foreign keys in SQL."}, {"human": "I see. How do I declare a property in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "In EdgeDB versions prior to 3.0, you would declare a property using the `property` keyword. However, in EdgeDB 3.0 and later, the `property` keyword is not required. You can simply declare properties directly. Here's an example in the updated SDL syntax:\n``sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  release_year: int16;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `Movie` is an object type with a required `title` property of type `str` and an optional `release_year` property of type `int16`."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And how about links?", "assistant": "Links are declared in a similar way to properties. You don't need to use the `link` keyword in the latest version of EdgeDB. Here's how you might define a link between a `Movie` and `Person` object types to represent actors in a movie:\n``sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n}\n``\nThe `multi` keyword indicates that a movie can have multiple actors, establishing a one-to-many relationship between `Movie` and `Person`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand what abstract types are in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, abstract types are a way to share common functionality and structure among other object types. They are defined with the keyword 'abstract' before the type name. You cannot create or store instances of abstract types directly, but you can use them as a base for other types that inherit their properties. Here's an example of an abstract type that includes a first name and a last name:"}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to define an abstract type?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you would define an abstract type called 'HasName' that includes a first name and a last name:"}, {"human": "Alright, let me see the code.", "assistant": "```sdl\nabstract type HasName {\n  first_name: str;\n  last_name: str;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how would I use this abstract type in other object types?", "assistant": "You would use it by creating a new object type that extends the abstract type. For example, if you want to create a 'Person' type that has a first name and a last name, you can extend the 'HasName' abstract type like this:"}, {"human": "Please show me the code for that.", "assistant": "```sdl\ntype Person extending HasName {\n  birthdate: datetime;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "This makes sense. So, 'Person' will automatically have 'first_name' and 'last_name' properties because it extends 'HasName', right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The 'Person' type will inherit the 'first_name' and 'last_name' properties from the 'HasName' abstract type. You can then add additional properties to the 'Person' type, like 'birthdate' in the example."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how inheritance works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, object types can extend other object types, which means that a type, known as a subtype, can inherit all the links, properties, indexes, constraints, and so on from its supertypes. This is similar to how inheritance works in object-oriented programming."}, {"human": "I see. Could you give me an example of how to define types with inheritance in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have an abstract object type called `Animal` with a property `species`. You can define a subtype called `Dog` that extends `Animal` and adds an additional property `breed`. Here's how you would define it in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype Animal {\n  species: str;\n}\n\ntype Dog extending Animal {\n  breed: str;\n}\n``"}, {"human": "What does it mean for the `Animal` type to be abstract?", "assistant": "An abstract type in EdgeDB is a type that cannot have any instances on its own. It's used as a template for other types to extend from. So you can't create an instance of `Animal` directly, but you can create instances of types that extend `Animal`, like `Dog`."}, {"human": "Got it. So if I create a `Dog` instance, will it automatically have a `species` property because it extends `Animal`?", "assistant": "Exactly! When you create an instance of `Dog`, it will inherit the `species` property from `Animal`. You'll be able to set and access `species` on a `Dog` instance just as if it was defined directly on the `Dog` type."}, {"human": "That's pretty neat. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how multiple inheritance works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, an object type can extend more than one type, and this is known as multiple inheritance. It allows you to build complex object types by combining more basic types. For example, you might have some basic abstract types that define certain properties, and then you can create a new type that inherits properties from all of those basic types."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how that would look in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have two abstract types, `HasName` and `HasEmail`. `HasName` includes first and last name properties, and `HasEmail` includes an email property. You can create a `Person` type that extends both `HasName` and `HasEmail` to include all three properties. Here's how it would look in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype HasName {\n  first_name: str;\n  last_name: str;\n}\n\ntype HasEmail {\n  email: str;\n}\n\ntype Person extending HasName, HasEmail {\n  # Person will have first_name, last_name, and email properties\n}\n``"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So the `Person` type will automatically have the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` properties without needing to redefine them?", "assistant": "Exactly! By using multiple inheritance, the `Person` type inherits all the properties from `HasName` and `HasEmail`. You don't need to redefine them in the `Person` type; they are included automatically because of the inheritance."}, {"human": "Is there a limit to how many types I can extend?", "assistant": "EdgeDB doesn't impose a strict limit on the number of types you can extend through multiple inheritance. However, it's important to design your schema carefully to ensure that it remains clear and manageable. Excessive use of multiple inheritance can make your schema complex and harder to understand."}, {"human": "What happens if the types I'm extending have overlapping properties?", "assistant": "If the types you're extending have properties with the same name, you'll need to resolve the conflict explicitly in the subtype. You can do this by redefining the property in the subtype. If the properties are meant to be the same, you can simply redefine it without changing the definition. If they are different, you might need to rename one of the properties to avoid the conflict."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use enums in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! Enums in EdgeDB are custom scalar types that extend the abstract enum type. You can declare an enum in your schema like this: ```sdl scalar type Color extending enum; type Shirt { color: Color; } ```"}, {"human": "I see, but how do I define the possible values for the Color enum?", "assistant": "To define the possible values for an enum, you include them directly within the enum declaration. Here's an example with some colors: ```sdl scalar type Color extending enum { Green, Blue, Red } type Shirt { color: Color; } ```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I reference these enum values in my EdgeQL queries?", "assistant": "In EdgeQL queries, you reference enum values using dot notation. For example, if you want to filter shirts by the color green, you would write: ```edgeql SELECT Shirt { color } FILTER .color = Color.Green; ```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. Is there anything important I should know about enums?", "assistant": "Yes, it's important to remember that when you're referencing enum values in EdgeQL, you always use the dot notation like `Color.Green`. Also, if you want to learn more about enums, you should check out the Enum documentation for a full reference."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how arrays work in EdgeDB. Can you help me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, arrays are used to store zero or more primitive values of the same type in an ordered list. They can contain primitive types like integers, strings, or JSON, but they cannot contain object types or other arrays."}, {"human": "So, how would I define an array in my schema?", "assistant": "You can define an array in your schema by using the SDL (Schema Definition Language). Here's an example of how you might define a type `Person` with a couple of array fields:"}, {"human": "Could you show me the SDL example?", "assistant": "Sure, here's a simple SDL example defining a `Person` type with arrays of strings and JSON values:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  str_array: array<str>;\n  json_array: array<json>;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `str_array` is an array that can store strings, and `json_array` is an array that can store JSON values."}, {"human": "What if I wanted to store an array of objects or another array inside an array?", "assistant": "That's not allowed in EdgeDB. Arrays cannot contain object types or other arrays. You would need to use a different approach, such as creating a separate type and linking to it with a multi link if you need to represent a one-to-many relationship."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And how do I query an array in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "To query an array in EdgeQL, you can use array functions and operators. For example, to select a `Person` and their `str_array` you might write a query like this:\n```\nSELECT Person {\n  str_array\n};\n```\nIf you want to filter based on an array's contents, you can use the `CONTAINS` operator. For example:\n```\nSELECT Person {\n  str_array\n} FILTER .str_array CONTAINS 'value';\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how tuples work in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Of course! Tuples in EdgeDB are ordered sequences of data, similar to arrays. However, unlike arrays, each element in a tuple can have a different type. This means you can mix primitives, objects, arrays, and even other tuples within a single tuple."}, {"human": "That sounds interesting. Can you show me an example of how to define a tuple in a schema?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example using SDL (Schema Definition Language) to define a type `Person` with various tuples:"}, {"human": "Could you provide the SDL example with the updated syntax?", "assistant": "Absolutely, here's the updated SDL example with the correct syntax:\n``sdl\ntype Person {\n  unnamed_tuple: tuple<str, int>;\n  nested_tuple: tuple<tuple<str, int>, tuple<str, bool>>;\n  tuple_of_arrays: tuple<array<str>, array<int>>;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `unnamed_tuple` is a tuple with a string and an integer, `nested_tuple` is a tuple containing two other tuples, and `tuple_of_arrays` is a tuple with two arrays, one of strings and one of integers."}, {"human": "I see, so the types inside the angle brackets define the types of the elements in the tuple?", "assistant": "Exactly! The types specified inside the angle brackets define the sequence and types of elements that the tuple will contain. Each position in the tuple is associated with the type defined at that position in the type declaration."}, {"human": "Can tuples be optional, or do they always have to have a value?", "assistant": "Tuples can be optional, just like any other property in EdgeDB. You can define an optional tuple by not marking it as `required`. If you want to make a tuple required, you would include the `required` keyword before the tuple definition."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to create an auto-incrementing ID for my database entries in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can create an auto-incrementing integer property by declaring a custom scalar that extends the abstract `sequence` type. This will initialize a global `int64` counter that auto-increments every time a new object is created. Would you like to see an example of how to define this in SDL?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's how you can define a custom scalar type that extends `sequence` for auto-incrementing values:\n```\nsdl\nscalar type tick extending sequence;\n```\nOnce you have this scalar type defined, you can use it in your object types as a property. For instance:\n```\nsdl\ntype User {\n  required id: tick;\n  required name: str;\n}\n```\nWith this setup, every time you create a new `User` object, the `id` property will automatically get a unique, auto-incremented `int64` value."}, {"human": "What happens if I use the same sequence type for different object types?", "assistant": "If you use the same sequence type for different object types, they will share the same global counter. This means that the counter will increment across all object types using that sequence, not just within a single type. For example, if you have a `User` type and an `Order` type both using the `tick` sequence, creating a new `User` or `Order` will increment the same counter, ensuring unique IDs across both types."}, {"human": "Got it. Can I have multiple sequences in the same database?", "assistant": "Yes, you can have multiple sequences in the same database. Each sequence you define will have its own independent counter. For example, you could define another sequence like this:\n```\nsdl\nscalar type another_tick extending sequence;\n```\nAnd then use it in another object type:\n```\nsdl\ntype Product {\n  required id: another_tick;\n  required name: str;\n}\n```\nThis way, `User` and `Product` will have separate auto-incrementing IDs, each managed by their respective sequence."}, {"human": "This is really helpful, thanks! Just to clarify, the counter is global and not resettable, right?", "assistant": "That's correct. The counter for a sequence is global within the context of the database and it is not designed to be reset. It will keep incrementing with each new object creation that uses the sequence type. This ensures that the values are unique and consistent throughout the lifetime of the database."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what properties are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, properties are used to associate primitive data with an object type or link. They are similar to fields or attributes in other databases or programming languages. Each property has a key, which is the name of the property, and a primitive type, such as `str` for strings, `int64` for 64-bit integers, or `bool` for booleans."}, {"human": "Could you give me an example of how to define properties in SDL?", "assistant": "Absolutely! Here's a simple example of an object type called `Player` with a few properties defined in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype Player {\n  email: str;\n  points: int64;\n  is_online: bool;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `Player` has three properties: `email` of type `str`, `points` of type `int64`, and `is_online` of type `bool`."}, {"human": "What does it mean by primitive type?", "assistant": "A primitive type refers to basic data types that are not composed of other types. In EdgeDB, primitive types are also known as scalar types. These include types like `str` for strings, `int64` for 64-bit integers, `bool` for boolean values, and others. They are the building blocks for properties and are used to define the kind of data a property can hold."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And can I make a property required or optional?", "assistant": "Yes, you can specify whether a property is required or optional. By default, properties are optional, but you can make a property required by using the `required` keyword. For example:\n``sdl\ntype Player {\n  required email: str;\n  points: int64;\n  is_online: bool;\n}\n``\nIn this case, `email` must be provided when creating a `Player` object, while `points` and `is_online` are optional."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to define properties in EdgeDB. Can you explain the difference between optional and required properties?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, properties can be defined as either optional or required. By default, properties are optional, meaning that it's not necessary to provide a value for them. However, if you want to ensure that a property must have a value, you can define it as 'required'. Here's an example using SDL (Schema Definition Language): ```sdl type User { required email: str; } ``` In this example, the 'email' property of the 'User' type is required, meaning that every User must have an email address."}, {"human": "Got it. So if I don't specify 'required', the property is optional by default?", "assistant": "Exactly! If you don't explicitly use the 'required' keyword, the property is considered optional, and it's not mandatory to provide a value for it when creating or updating records of that type."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to create a User without an email since it's required?", "assistant": "If you attempt to create a User instance without providing a value for the 'email' property, which is marked as required, EdgeDB will raise an error. The operation will be rejected because the 'email' property is mandatory for all User instances."}, {"human": "Makes sense. Thanks for the clarification!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand property cardinality in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, each property has a cardinality, which can be either `single` or `multi`. By default, properties are `single`, which means they can hold only one value. If you want a property to hold multiple values, you would use `multi`, which allows the property to contain an unordered set of values."}, {"human": "So, if I want a user to have multiple nicknames, how would I define that in the schema?", "assistant": "You would define it using the `multi` keyword. Here's how you can define a `User` type with a `multi` property for nicknames in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype User {\n  name: str;\n  multi nicknames: str;\n}\n``In this example, `name` is a single property, which is the default, so we don't need to specify `single`. `nicknames` is a multi property, which can hold an unordered set of strings."}, {"human": "What does it mean that the set is unordered?", "assistant": "An unordered set means that the collection of values doesn't have a specific sequence. The values are stored without any particular order, and when you retrieve them, they may come back in any order. This is different from a list or an array, where the order of elements is preserved."}, {"human": "Got it. And can you give me an example of how to insert multiple nicknames for a user?", "assistant": "Sure! When inserting a user with multiple nicknames, you would use EdgeQL, which is EdgeDB's query language. Here's an example of how to insert a user with several nicknames:\n```edgedb\nINSERT User {\n  name := 'Alice',\n  nicknames := {'Lissy', 'Al', 'Ace'}\n};\n```This EdgeQL statement creates a new `User` with the name 'Alice' and three nicknames in the set."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how default values work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, properties can have default values. These defaults can either be static values or EdgeQL expressions that are evaluated when a new record is inserted. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's a simple example using SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n```\nsdl\ntype Player {\n  required points: int64 {\n    default := 0;\n  }\n  required latitude: float64 {\n    default := (360 * random() - 180);\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have a `Player` type with two properties: `points` and `latitude`. The `points` property is an integer with a default value of 0. The `latitude` property is a float, and its default value is set using an EdgeQL expression that generates a random number between -180 and 180."}, {"human": "What happens if I don't provide a value for a property with a default when inserting a new record?", "assistant": "If you don't provide a value for a property that has a default value when inserting a new record, EdgeDB will automatically use the default value for that property. For the `points` property in our example, if you don't specify a value upon insertion, it will default to 0. For the `latitude` property, it will evaluate the expression and use the resulting random number as the default."}, {"human": "Can the default value be any EdgeQL expression?", "assistant": "Yes, the default value can be any valid EdgeQL expression that returns a value compatible with the type of the property. In the case of the `latitude` property, we used the expression `(360 * random() - 180)` to generate a random float value that's within the range of valid latitude values."}, {"human": "Is it possible to update the default value later?", "assistant": "Yes, you can update the default value later by altering the schema. However, keep in mind that changing the default value will only affect new records inserted after the change. Existing records will retain the value they were created with, unless explicitly updated."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what 'readonly' properties are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a property can be marked as 'readonly'. This means that the property can be set at the time of object creation, but it cannot be modified after that. It's a way to ensure that certain fields remain constant throughout the lifetime of an object in the database."}, {"human": "I see. Could you show me an example of how to define a readonly property in SDL?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's an example where we define a `User` type with a `readonly` property called `external_id` of type `uuid`. The `readonly` attribute is set to `true`, indicating that once the `external_id` is set during the creation of a `User` object, it cannot be changed later.\n\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required external_id: uuid {\n    readonly := true;\n  }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So after I create a User with an external_id, I won't be able to update that field anymore?", "assistant": "Exactly! Once a `User` object is created with a specific `external_id`, that `external_id` is permanent and cannot be updated. If you try to modify a `readonly` property, EdgeDB will raise an error."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the clarification!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how constraints work in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Of course! Constraints in EdgeDB are rules that you can apply to properties to enforce certain conditions. They ensure the integrity of your data. For example, you can ensure that a string property has a minimum length, or that the values are unique across all instances of a type."}, {"human": "I see. Could you give me an example of how to use constraints in a schema?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a `BlogPost` type and you want to make sure that each blog post has a unique title, a title length of at least 8 characters but no more than 30, and that the title only contains alphanumeric characters. Here's how you could define that in SDL:"}, {"human": "That would be helpful, thanks!", "assistant": "```sdl\ntype BlogPost {\n  title: str {\n    constraint exclusive; # all post titles must be unique\n    constraint min_len_value(8); # title must be at least 8 characters\n    constraint max_len_value(30); # title must be no more than 30 characters\n    constraint regexp(r'^[A-Za-z0-9]+$'); # title must be alphanumeric\n  }\n  # ... other properties and links ...\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it! And how would I enforce these constraints in practice?", "assistant": "Once you've defined these constraints in your SDL and applied the schema, EdgeDB will automatically enforce them for you. When you try to insert or update a `BlogPost` instance, EdgeDB will check the `title` against these constraints. If any of them fail, EdgeDB will raise an error and the operation will not be completed."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to insert a blog post with a title that's already taken?", "assistant": "If you try to insert a blog post with a title that already exists, the `exclusive` constraint will be violated. EdgeDB will prevent the insertion and return an error indicating that the `title` value is not unique."}, {"human": "Makes sense. And what about the regular expression constraint?", "assistant": "The regular expression constraint ensures that the `title` matches a specific pattern. In the example provided, the `regexp` constraint with the pattern `r'^[A-Za-z0-9]+$'` means that the title can only contain uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. If you try to insert a title with special characters or spaces, it will fail this constraint."}, {"human": "That clears things up. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or constraints, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what annotations are in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Sure! Annotations in EdgeDB are like small human-readable notes that you can add to properties within your schema. They're used to provide additional information about the property, such as a title, a description, or to indicate if something is deprecated. You can also create custom annotations if you need to."}, {"human": "Interesting. Can you show me an example of how to use annotations?", "assistant": "Absolutely! Here's an example of a `User` type with an `email` property that has several annotations including a title and a description:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  email: str {\n    annotation title := 'Email address';\n    annotation description := \"The user's email address.\";\n    # ... other annotations ...\n  }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What do the built-in annotations do?", "assistant": "The built-in annotations like `title` and `description` are used to provide a human-friendly name and a detailed explanation of what the property is for, respectively. The `deprecated` annotation can be used to mark a property as obsolete or no longer recommended for use. This can be helpful for anyone reading the schema to understand the intent and status of different schema elements."}, {"human": "Can I create my own annotations?", "assistant": "Yes, you can create custom annotations. Custom annotations can be declared in your schema and used to store metadata that is specific to your application's needs. For example, you might create an annotation to indicate which properties should be indexed for search or to store display hints for a front-end application."}, {"human": "How would I declare a custom annotation?", "assistant": "To declare a custom annotation, you would define it in your schema like this:\n```sdl\nannotation my_custom_annotation;\n```\nAfter declaring it, you can use it on properties just like the built-in annotations:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  email: str {\n    annotation my_custom_annotation := 'Some custom value';\n  }\n}\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what abstract properties are in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, properties can be either concrete or abstract. Abstract properties are declared independently of any specific type, meaning they don't belong to a particular source or target. They can include annotations, which are like notes or metadata, and they can also be marked as `readonly`, indicating that their values cannot be changed after being set."}, {"human": "I see, do you have an example of how to define an abstract property?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example of how you might define an abstract property for an email address in SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n```sdl\nabstract email_prop {\n  annotation title := 'An email address';\n  readonly := true;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Great, and how would I use this abstract property in a type, like a Student type?", "assistant": "To use an abstract property in a type, you would include it in the type definition. Here's how you could do it for a `Student` type:\n```sdl\ntype Student {\n  # Inherits the abstract property\n  email: email_prop;\n}\n```In this example, the `Student` type has an `email` property that inherits the characteristics of the `email_prop` abstract property, including the annotation and the `readonly` constraint."}, {"human": "That makes sense. So, the Student type will have an email property that's read-only and has the annotation 'An email address'?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `Student` type will have an `email` property that is read-only due to the `readonly` constraint in the abstract property definition. Additionally, the `email` property will inherit the annotation 'An email address', which provides descriptive information about the property."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what triggers are in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, triggers are a way to define an expression that will be executed automatically whenever a certain type of query is run on an object type. When the specified query occurs, it will 'trigger' the expression you've defined to run in the same transaction as the original query. You can set up triggers within your schema."}, {"human": "So, can I use a trigger to modify the object that caused the trigger to run?", "assistant": "Actually, no. It's important to note that triggers cannot be used to modify the object that set off the trigger. They are meant for running additional expressions that may relate to other operations or logging, but not for altering the triggering object itself."}, {"human": "Got it. How do I define a trigger in my schema?", "assistant": "To define a trigger in your schema, you would use the SDL (Schema Definition Language). Unfortunately, the documentation snippet doesn't provide a specific example of the SDL syntax for triggers. However, typically, you would define a trigger within the type definition where you want the trigger to apply."}, {"human": "Can you give me a hypothetical example of what that SDL might look like?", "assistant": "Sure, while I don't have the exact syntax from the documentation, a hypothetical SDL example might look something like this:\n\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  # Define properties and links here\n\n  # Hypothetical syntax for a trigger\n  create trigger on_insert_trigger after insert {\n    # Expression to execute when a new User is inserted\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this hypothetical example, `on_insert_trigger` is a trigger that would run after a new `User` object is inserted into the database. Inside the curly braces, you would define the expression that should be executed when the trigger fires."}, {"human": "I see, that helps. I'll look for more details in the EdgeDB documentation. Thanks!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance as you explore EdgeDB, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use triggers for validation in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can use triggers to perform validation checks. For example, if you have a `Person` type with two multi links named `friends` and `enemies`, you might want to ensure that these two sets of links are mutually exclusive. You can write a trigger that will be called to validate that there are no common objects between these links. Would you like to see a code snippet on how to set this up?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me the code!", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's an example of how you might define a trigger for validation in SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n```\nmodule default {\n\n  type Person {\n    multi friends: Person;\n    multi enemies: Person;\n\n    constraint exclusive as (SELECT\n      EXISTS(\n        SELECT Person\n        FILTER Person.friends ?= Person.enemies\n      )\n    ) {\n      errmessage := 'friends and enemies sets must be exclusive';\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n```\nIn this example, we define a constraint named `exclusive` on the `Person` type. The constraint uses an EdgeQL query to check if there are any overlaps between the `friends` and `enemies` links. If there is an overlap, the constraint will fail, and an error message will be displayed."}, {"human": "I see, but I thought we were talking about triggers. Isn't this a constraint?", "assistant": "You're right, I apologize for the confusion. The example I provided is indeed a constraint. For validation using triggers, you would use the `assert()` function inside the trigger body to enforce the rule. Let me correct that with an appropriate trigger example:\n```\nmodule default {\n\n  type Person {\n    multi friends: Person;\n    multi enemies: Person;\n  }\n\n  create migration {\n    using (\n      CREATE TRIGGER validate_friends_enemies\n      BEFORE UPDATE ON Person\n      EXECUTE (\n        SELECT assert(\n          NOT EXISTS(\n            SELECT Person\n            FILTER Person.friends ?= Person.enemies\n          ),\n          'A person cannot be both a friend and an enemy.'\n        )\n      );\n    );\n  }\n\n}\n```\nIn this trigger, `validate_friends_enemies` is executed before any update on the `Person` type. It uses the `assert()` function to check that there are no `Person` objects that are both in the `friends` and `enemies` sets. If such a case is found, the assertion will fail, and the update will be prevented with the specified error message."}, {"human": "Got it, that makes sense now. So the trigger will prevent any updates that would violate this rule?", "assistant": "Exactly! The trigger will run before the update operation, and if the condition in the `assert()` function evaluates to `false`, the update will be blocked, and an error message will be returned. This ensures data integrity according to the rules you've defined in your triggers."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to remove data from my EdgeDB database. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can delete objects from the database using the `delete` command. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you have a type called `Hero` and you want to delete the hero named 'Iron Man'. You would use the following EdgeQL command:\n```edgeql\ndelete Hero filter .name = 'Iron Man';\n```"}, {"human": "That looks simple enough. What if I want to delete all heroes, not just Iron Man?", "assistant": "To delete all objects of a certain type, you can use the `delete` command without a filter. Like this:\n```edgeql\ndelete Hero;\n```Just be careful with this command, as it will remove all `Hero` objects from the database."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And what if I only want to delete heroes with a certain condition, like all heroes who are not part of the Avengers?", "assistant": "In that case, you would use the `filter` clause with the appropriate condition. Here's an example that deletes all heroes who are not part of the Avengers:\n```edgeql\ndelete Hero filter .memberOf != 'Avengers';\n```This command will delete every `Hero` object where the `memberOf` property does not equal 'Avengers'."}, {"human": "This is really helpful, thank you! I'll try these commands out.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use deletion statements in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, deletion statements can be enhanced with various clauses such as `filter`, `order by`, `offset`, and `limit`. These clauses help you specify which records you want to delete."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of a deletion statement with these clauses?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example where we delete heroes from a database, but we only want to delete those whose names start with 'the '. We also want to order the results by name, skip the first 10 records, and limit the deletion to 5 records. The EdgeQL statement would look like this:\n```edgeql\ndelete Hero filter .name ilike 'the %' order by .name offset 10 limit 5;\n```"}, {"human": "What does `ilike` do in the filter clause?", "assistant": "`ilike` is a case-insensitive pattern matching operator. In the filter clause, `.name ilike 'the %'` means that it will match any hero whose name starts with 'the ' regardless of case. So it would match 'The Flash', 'the flash', 'THE FLASH', and so on."}, {"human": "I see. And what if I want to delete all heroes except the ones starting with 'the '?", "assistant": "To delete all heroes except those whose names start with 'the ', you would use the `not` operator in conjunction with `ilike` in the filter clause. Here's how you would write it:\n```edgeql\ndelete Hero filter not .name ilike 'the %';\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And where can I find more information about these clauses?", "assistant": "You can find full documentation on these clauses in the 'Select' section of the EdgeQL documentation. They work similarly in select statements, so understanding them there will help you use them in deletion statements as well."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to delete a Hero object from my EdgeDB database, but I keep getting a ConstraintViolationError. What's going on?", "assistant": "Hello! It sounds like you're encountering a link deletion policy issue. In EdgeDB, every link has an associated deletion policy. By default, you can't delete an object if it's linked to by another object. This is to prevent accidental data loss."}, {"human": "I see. So, how can I delete a Hero object that is linked to by another object?", "assistant": "To delete a Hero object that is linked to by another object, you would need to either update the deletion policy to allow the deletion or remove the links that are preventing the deletion. However, changing the deletion policy should be done with caution to avoid unintended data loss."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of what the error looks like?", "assistant": "Certainly! When you try to delete a Hero object that is linked to by another object without the proper deletion policy, you might see an error like this:\n```edgeql-repl\ndb> delete Hero filter .name = \"Yelena Belova\";\nConstraintViolationError: deletion of default::Hero (af7076e0-3e98-11ec-abb3-b3435bbe7c7e) is prohibited by link target policy {}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So, what should I do if I really need to delete this Hero object?", "assistant": "If you need to delete the Hero object, you should first ensure that no other objects require it. If the Hero is linked from another object, you may need to delete the link or the object that holds the link first. After you've taken care of the links, you should be able to delete the Hero object without encountering the ConstraintViolationError."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm a bit confused about how the delete statement works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, when you use a `delete` statement, it removes the specified objects from the database. However, the interesting part is that the statement actually returns the set of objects that were deleted. This allows you to perform a `select` on the deleted set to fetch properties and links of these objects one last time before they're gone for good."}, {"human": "That sounds useful, but I'm not sure how to actually do that. Could you show me an example?", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you have a `Movie` type and you want to delete a movie with the title 'Untitled'. Here's how you could delete the movie and then select its properties and links right after deletion:\n```edgeql\nwith movie := (delete Movie filter .title = 'Untitled')\nselect movie {\n    # You can list the properties and links you want to fetch here\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so the `with` block is used to hold the deleted movie. But what if I want to get the title and the release year of the movie that was deleted?", "assistant": "You would specify those properties within the `select` block. Here's how you would do it:\n```edgeql\nwith movie := (delete Movie filter .title = 'Untitled')\nselect movie {\n    title,\n    release_year\n}\n```This will return the title and release year of the movie that you just deleted."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And this data is no longer available after this `select`, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! This is your last chance to access the data of the deleted objects. Once the transaction is complete, the data is permanently removed from the database."}]}

Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's a simple example where we iterate over a set of numbers and for each number, we select the number itself and the number plus 0.5, then merge all results into a single set:\n```edgeql\nfor number in {0, 1, 2, 3}\nunion (\n  select { number, number + 0.5 }\n);\n```\nWhen you run this query, you'll get a set that includes the original numbers and each number incremented by 0.5: `{0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5}`."}, {"human": "What if I want to iterate over a set of strings instead?", "assistant": "You can iterate over any set, including strings. For example, if you have a set of names and you want to create a greeting for each name, you could write something like this:\n```edgeql\nfor name in {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}\nunion (\n  select {'Hello, ' ++ name ++ '!'}\n);\n```\nThis would produce a set of greetings for each name in the input set."}, {"human": "Got it! And can I use 'for' loops with more complex queries?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can use 'for' loops with more complex expressions and even nest them within other queries. Just remember that the body of the 'for' loop should contain expressions that make sense for each element of the input set. If you have a specific scenario in mind, I can help you craft a query for it."}]}

It iterates over a set of hero names - 'Cersi', 'Ikaris', and 'Thena' - and for each name, it inserts a new `Hero` with that name. The `union` operator is used to combine all the insert operations into a single query."}, {"human": "I see. And what will be the result of this operation?", "assistant": "After executing this query, you'll have three new `Hero` entries in your database, each with a unique ID and the name you specified in the set.

And can I use variables in the set instead of hardcoding the names?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use variables. If you have a list of hero names stored in a variable, you can use that variable in place of the hardcoded set. Just make sure that the variable is a set of strings, as the `for` statement expects a set to iterate over."}, {"human": "Great, I'll try that out.

Would you like to see an example of how to achieve this?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me the workaround.", "assistant": "Alright, here's how you can write a query to either select an existing admin user or insert a new one if none exists:\n\n```edgeql\nwith\n  admin := (select User filter .role = 'admin' limit 1),\n  new_admin := (insert User {role := 'admin'})\nselect\n  coalesce(admin, new_admin) if count(admin) = 0 else admin;\n```\n\nThis query uses a `with` block to define two expressions: one for selecting the admin and another for creating a new admin. The `coalesce` function is then used to return the first non-`None` value (which will be the new admin if no existing admin was found), but only if the count of admins is zero; otherwise, it returns the existing admin."}, {"human": "I see, but won't this insert a new admin user every time the query is run?", "assistant": "Good catch!

And how can I reference other objects during insertion, like adding a nemesis to a hero?", "assistant": "To reference other objects, you would use a subquery or a SELECT statement to find the object you want to reference.

So what does the output mean after I run the insert command?", "assistant": "After you run the insert command, EdgeDB will return the newly created object. The output will include the type of the object and its unique ID. For instance, in the example I gave you, the output `{default::Hero {id: b0fbe9de-3e90-11ec-8c12-ffa2d5f0176a}}` indicates that a `Hero` object was created with the specified ID."}, {"human": "Got it.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how nested inserts work in EdgeDB. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! Nested inserts in EdgeDB allow you to insert an object and its related objects in a single query.

The 'nemesis' link of the 'Villain' is being set to a new 'Hero' object that is created within the same insert statement. This allows you to build complex object hierarchies in a single operation, which can be very efficient and convenient."}, {"human": "What happens if there's an error with the Hero insert? Does the Villain still get created?", "assistant": "No, if there's an error with any part of a nested insert, the entire operation is rolled back. This ensures data integrity, so you won't end up with a Villain without a nemesis if the Hero insert fails for some reason."}, {"human": "Got it, that makes sense.

Let's say you have a character named 'Black Widow' that you want to select as both a character in a movie and as the nemesis of another character.

This way, if the movie already exists, the conflict will be handled without causing an error."}, {"human": "That sounds useful. Can you show me an example of how to use `unless conflict` when inserting a movie?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's how you can insert the movie 'Eternals' with a release year of 2021, using the `unless conflict` clause to avoid inserting a duplicate:\n```edgeql\ninsert Movie {\n  title := 'Eternals',\n  release_year := 2021\n} unless conflict on .title;\n```This will insert the movie only if there isn't already a movie with the title 'Eternals' in the database."}, {"human": "What happens if there is a conflict?", "assistant": "If there's a conflict, meaning a movie with the title 'Eternals' already exists, the `insert` operation will be skipped, and no new record will be added. The database will remain unchanged, and you won't get an error."}, {"human": "Can I update the existing record if there's a conflict instead of skipping the insert?", "assistant": "Yes, you can specify an `on conflict` action to update the existing record. For example, if you want to update the release year in case of a conflict, you can do it like this:\n```edgeql\ninsert Movie {\n  title := 'Eternals',\n  release_year := 2021\n} unless conflict on .title else update set {\n  release_year := 2021\n};\n```This will update the `release_year` of the existing 'Eternals' movie to 2021 if it already exists."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I've heard about upserts in databases. Can you explain how upserts work in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, an upsert is a single EdgeQL query that attempts to insert a new record, but if a record with the specified unique constraints already exists, it updates that record instead.

If there's a conflict, the `else` clause will execute an update statement to set the `release_year` to 2021."}, {"human": "What if I want to update some other fields as well, not just the release year?", "assistant": "You can update any number of fields in the `else` clause. The `else` clause can contain any EdgeQL expression, including a complex update statement. For example, if you wanted to update the description as well, you could do it like this:\n```edgeql\nwith\n  title := 'Eternals',\n  release_year := 2021,\n  description := 'A new team of superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.'\ninsert Movie {\n  title := title,\n  release_year := release_year\n}\nunless conflict on .title\nelse (\n  update Movie set {\n    release_year := release_year,\n    description := description\n  }\n)\n```\nThis will update both the `release_year` and `description` fields if a movie with the title 'Eternals' already exists."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to insert data into my EdgeDB database, but I'm worried about running into constraint violations. Is there a way to handle that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `unless conflict` clause to handle potential constraint violations when inserting data.

And what about that 'r' before the string?", "assistant": "The 'r' before a string denotes a raw string literal. In raw strings, backslashes are treated as literal characters and not as escape characters. This is useful when you want to include backslashes in your string without escaping them, such as when defining regular expressions or file paths.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```edgeql\nselect r'\\n represents a newline character.';\n-- Output: {'\\\\n represents a newline character.'}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how date durations work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, a `cal::date_duration` represents a span of time consisting of a certain number of months and days. It's used to perform operations on `cal::local_date` values, like adding or subtracting durations to or from dates."}, {"human": "So how would I represent a duration of 5 days in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You can represent a duration of 5 days as a string in the format `'5 days'`. When you select it in EdgeDB, it will be displayed as `{'P5D'}`. Here's how you can do it in EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nSELECT '5 days';\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to add 5 days to a specific date, say June 25, 2022?", "assistant": "You can add a duration to a date by using the `+` operator. For example, to add 5 days to June 25, 2022, you would write the following query: \n```edgeql\nSELECT '2022-06-25' + '5 days';\n``` \nThe result would be `{'2022-06-30'}`."}, {"human": "And how do I find the duration between two dates?", "assistant": "To find the duration between two dates, you subtract one date from the other using the `-` operator.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what ranges are in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, ranges represent a sequence of orderable scalar values. They consist of a lower bound and an upper bound. Additionally, ranges have two boolean flags that indicate whether the lower and upper bounds are inclusive or not."}, {"human": "Okay, that makes sense. How do I create a range in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You can create a range using the `range` constructor function. For example, if you want to create a range from 1 to 10, you would use the following EdgeQL command: `select range(1, 10);`. By default, this will create a range where the lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound is exclusive."}, {"human": "What does it mean for the bounds to be inclusive or exclusive?", "assistant": "An inclusive bound means that the value specified as the bound is included in the range. An exclusive bound means that the value is not included. For instance, in the range `range(1, 10)`, the lower bound 1 is included (inclusive), but the upper bound 10 is not included (exclusive)."}, {"human": "Can I change whether the bounds are inclusive or exclusive?", "assistant": "Yes, you can specify the inclusivity of the bounds using the `inc_lower` and `inc_upper` flags. For example, if you want both bounds to be inclusive, you would write: `select range(1, 10, inc_lower := true, inc_upper := true);`. This will include both 1 and 10 in the range."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me an example where the lower bound is exclusive and the upper bound is inclusive?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's how you would create a range with an exclusive lower bound and an inclusive upper bound: `select range(1, 10, inc_lower := false, inc_upper := true);`.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to work with binary data in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, binary data is represented using the `bytes` type. This type is used to store raw binary data."}, {"human": "Is there a special way to write binary data in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Yes, there is. You can declare raw byte strings which treat the backslash `\\` as a literal character instead of an escape character. This is done by prefixing the string with `rb` before the opening quote. For example: `rb'hello\\nthere'`."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use this in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example where we select a raw byte string that includes a binary character and a backslash: \n```edgeql\nSELECT b'bina\\\\x01ry';\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return: `{b'bina\\\\x01ry'}`."}, {"human": "And what about the special syntax with `rb`?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's how you would use the `rb` prefix to select a raw byte string that includes a newline character represented as `\\n`: \n```edgeql\nSELECT rb'hello\\nthere';\n```\nThis will return the bytes without interpreting the `\\n` as a newline character, resulting in: `{b'hello\\\\nthere'}`."}, {"human": "Great, that makes sense. So the `rb` just ensures that escape sequences aren't processed, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! Using `rb` ensures that the string is treated as raw bytes and that escape sequences like `\\n` or `\\x01` are not processed but are instead part of the actual byte sequence."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how arrays work in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, an array is an ordered collection of values that are all of the same type. You can create an array by enclosing a list of values in square brackets. Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some examples.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here are a few examples of arrays in EdgeQL, which is the query language for EdgeDB:\n\nTo select an array of integers:\n```edgeql\nselect [1, 2, 3];\n```\n\nTo select an array of strings:\n```edgeql\nselect ['hello', 'world'];\n```\n\nAnd to select an array of tuples:\n```edgeql\nselect [(1, 2), (100, 200)];\n```\n\nEach of these commands will return the array as a set with one element."}, {"human": "What can I do with arrays in EdgeDB? Are there special functions or operators?", "assistant": "Yes, EdgeDB provides a set of functions and operators that you can use on arrays. For example, you can access elements by their index, slice arrays, and perform other operations. Unfortunately, I don't have the full documentation here, but if you have a specific operation in mind, I can certainly help you with that!"}, {"human": "I'd like to know how to access an element at a specific position in an array.", "assistant": "To access an element at a specific index in an array, you use the index operator, which is denoted by square brackets. In EdgeDB, array indexes start at zero. Here's how you can access the first element of an array:\n\n```edgeql\nselect [1, 2, 3][0];\n```\n\nThis will return the first element, which is `1` in this case."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what tuples are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Sure! A tuple in EdgeDB is a fixed-length, ordered collection of values. Each element within a tuple can have a different type. This means you can mix scalars, arrays, other tuples, and even object types within a single tuple."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of a tuple in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Absolutely! Here's a simple example of a tuple that contains a string, an integer, and a boolean value: ```edgeql-repl db> select ('Apple', 7, true); {('Apple', 7, true)}```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. Can we name the elements in a tuple?", "assistant": "Yes, you can optionally assign a key to each element of a tuple. This allows you to access the elements by their key, which can make your code more readable and maintainable."}, {"human": "How would I go about assigning keys to elements in a tuple?", "assistant": "To assign keys to elements in a tuple, you simply specify the key followed by the value for each element. For example: ```edgeql-repl db> select (fruit: 'Apple', quantity: 7, in_stock: true); {(fruit: 'Apple', quantity: 7, in_stock: true)}``` In this tuple, 'fruit' is the key for 'Apple', 'quantity' is the key for 7, and 'in_stock' is the key for true."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how indexing works with tuples in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can access elements of a tuple using dot notation. This works for both named and unnamed tuples. For unnamed tuples, you use numerical indexes, starting with 0. For named tuples, you can use either the key name or numerical indexes. Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some examples.", "assistant": "Alright, here's how you would access elements from an unnamed tuple:\n```edgeql\nselect (1, 3.14, 'red').0;  # This will return {1}\nselect (1, 3.14, 'red').2;  # This will return {'red'}\n```\nAnd here's how you access elements from a named tuple:\n```edgeql\nselect (name := 'george', age := 12).name;  # This will return {('george')}\n```\nIn the case of the named tuple, you can also use numerical indexing if you prefer."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to access an index that doesn't exist?", "assistant": "If you try to access an index that doesn't exist in the tuple, EdgeDB will raise an error indicating that the index is out of range. It's similar to how you would get an error in other programming languages when you try to access an index outside the bounds of an array or list."}, {"human": "Got it. And can I use these tuple indexes in more complex queries?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use tuple indexing in more complex queries. For example, you can filter results based on the value of a tuple element, or you can use tuple elements in expressions and functions. It's a flexible feature that integrates well with EdgeQL's querying capabilities."}, {"human": "Thanks for the help! I think I understand tuple indexing in EdgeDB now.", "assistant": "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask."}]}

In EdgeDB, the `bool` type is used to represent boolean values, which can be either `true` or `false`. You can use boolean values in your queries just like you would in other programming languages. Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some basic examples of boolean values in queries.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's how you can select boolean values directly in EdgeQL, the query language for EdgeDB:\n```edgeql\nselect true;\nselect false;\n```These queries will return `{true}` and `{false}` respectively."}, {"human": "What about comparing boolean values? How does that work?", "assistant": "EdgeDB provides comparison operators for booleans, such as `=`, `!=`, `?=`, and `?!=`. For example, to check if two boolean expressions are equal, you can use the `=` operator:\n```edgeql\nselect true = false;  # This will return {false}\n```To check if they are not equal, you can use the `!=` operator:\n```edgeql\nselect true != false;  # This will return {true}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And what are the logical operators available?", "assistant": "EdgeDB supports the standard logical operators `or`, `and`, and `not`. Here's how you can use them:\n```edgeql\nselect true or false;  # Returns {true}\nselect true and false; # Returns {false}\nselect not true;      # Returns {false}\n```These operators allow you to combine or negate boolean expressions."}, {"human": "Is there a way to work with collections of booleans?", "assistant": "Yes, EdgeDB provides aggregation functions like `all()` and `any()` for working with collections of booleans. The `all()` function returns `true` if all elements in a collection are `true`, and `any()` returns `true` if any element is `true`. Here's an example:\n```edgeql\nselect all({true, true, false});  # Returns {false}\nselect any({true, true, false});  # Returns {true}\n```"}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand the different numerical types in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! EdgeDB supports several numerical types within its type system. Here's a quick overview:\n- `int16`: A 16-bit integer.\n- `int32`: A 32-bit integer.\n- `int64`: A 64-bit integer.\n- `float32`: A 32-bit floating point number.\n- `float64`: A 64-bit floating point number.\n- `bigint`: An arbitrary precision integer.\n- `decimal`: An arbitrary precision number.\nEach type is suited for different ranges of values and precision requirements."}, {"human": "Great, thanks! How would I define a property with one of these types in SDL?", "assistant": "Defining a property with a numerical type in SDL is straightforward. Here's an example of how you might define properties with different numerical types in a type definition:\n```sdl\ntype Example {\n  small_number: int16;\n  regular_number: int32;\n  large_number: int64;\n  precise_number: decimal;\n}\n```\nIn this example, `small_number` is a 16-bit integer, `regular_number` is a 32-bit integer, `large_number` is a 64-bit integer, and `precise_number` is an arbitrary precision number."}, {"human": "I see.

Here's an example that corresponds to the SDL we just defined:\n```edgeql\nINSERT Example {\n  small_number := 123,\n  regular_number := 12345,\n  large_number := 123456789012345,\n  precise_number := 1234567890.123456789\n};\n```\nThis will create a new `Example` object with values for each of the numerical properties we defined."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I need to handle really large numbers?", "assistant": "For really large numbers, you would use the `bigint` type, which allows for arbitrary precision integers, or the `decimal` type for arbitrary precision numbers that include decimals. These types are useful when you need to handle values that exceed the capacity of standard integer or floating-point types. Here's how you might define a property with `bigint` in SDL:\n```sdl\ntype FinancialRecord {\n  huge_amount: bigint;\n}\n```\nAnd you would insert a value like this:\n```edgeql\nINSERT FinancialRecord {\n  huge_amount := 123456789012345678901234567890;\n};\n```\nThis allows you to work with numbers that are much larger than what `int64` or `float64` can represent."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how UUIDs work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, the `uuid` type is commonly used to represent object identifiers, which are unique identifiers for database entries. A UUID is a 128-bit number that guarantees uniqueness across space and time."}, {"human": "How do I use a UUID in EdgeDB? Do I just type it in?", "assistant": "To use a UUID in EdgeDB, you need to explicitly cast it from a string value that matches the UUID specification.

Here's how you do it: \n```edgeql\nselect uuid_generate_v1mc();\n```"}, {"human": "What does the 'v1mc' in that function mean?", "assistant": "The 'v1mc' in `uuid_generate_v1mc()` stands for Version 1, MAC address, with random component. It's a version of UUID that uses the MAC address of the host (with a random component) and the current time to generate a UUID, ensuring it's unique."}, {"human": "Got it.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how enums work in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, enum types are a way to define a type that has a fixed set of possible values. You need to declare them in your schema first. Here's how you can declare an enum type called 'Color':\n```sdl\nscalar type Color extending enum;\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So how do I use this 'Color' enum once I've declared it?", "assistant": "After declaring the enum, you can use enum literals in your queries. There are two ways to do this. You can use dot notation like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Color.Red;\n```\nOr you can cast a string literal to the enum type like this:\n```edgeql\nselect <Color>'Red';\n```Both will select the 'Red' value from the 'Color' enum."}, {"human": "I see. So if I wanted to add more colors to the enum, how would I do that?", "assistant": "To add more colors to the 'Color' enum, you would define them when you declare your enum type in the schema. Here's an example with multiple colors:\n```sdl\nscalar type Color extending enum<'Red', 'Green', 'Blue'>;\n```Now, 'Red', 'Green', and 'Blue' are the possible values for the 'Color' enum."}, {"human": "That makes sense. And how do I use these values in my database queries?", "assistant": "You can use these enum values in your queries just like any other value. For example, if you have a type 'Car' with a property 'color' of type 'Color', you could query for all cars with the color 'Red' like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Car filter .color = Color.Red;\n```This query filters the 'Car' set to only include cars where the 'color' property is set to 'Red'."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand the temporal types in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! EdgeDB has several temporal types to handle dates and times. These include `datetime` for timezone-aware points in time, `cal::local_datetime` for date and time without timezone, `cal::local_date` for just the date, and `cal::local_time` for just the time."}, {"human": "I see. How do I declare a temporal literal in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Temporal literals are declared by casting a string with the appropriate format to the desired temporal type. For example, to declare a `datetime` literal, you would write something like this: `SELECT <datetime>'2023-04-12T15:30:00+00:00';`"}, {"human": "Got it. And what about the other types like `cal::local_date`?", "assistant": "For `cal::local_date`, you would cast a string representing the date. Here's an example: `SELECT <cal::local_date>'2023-04-12';`. Similarly, you can declare `cal::local_datetime` and `cal::local_time` literals by casting strings in their respective formats."}, {"human": "Could you show me an example for `cal::local_datetime` and `cal::local_time`?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's an example for `cal::local_datetime`: `SELECT <cal::local_datetime>'2023-04-12T15:30:00';` and for `cal::local_time`: `SELECT <cal::local_time>'15:30:00';`. Just make sure your string literals are in the correct format for the type you're casting to."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how durations work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, the `duration` type is used to represent exact durations. It's a precise span of time measured in microseconds. You can use it to represent time intervals with units like microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and hours. Durations can also be negative, indicating a time interval that goes backwards."}, {"human": "Interesting. Can you show me how to select a duration in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you can select a duration of 45.6 seconds in EdgeDB using EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nSELECT '45.6 seconds';\n```\nThe result will be displayed as `{'0:00:45.6'}`."}, {"human": "What about negative durations?", "assistant": "Negative durations are just as easy to represent. For example, if you want to select a duration that represents negative 15 microseconds, you would write: \n```edgeql\nSELECT '-15 microseconds';\n```\nAnd the result will be `{'-0:00:00.000015'}`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand the difference between durations in EdgeDB. Can you explain what a 'relative duration' is?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a `cal::relative_duration` represents a duration that's based on calendar units, like '1 month' or '2 years'. These durations are not fixed in terms of milliseconds because the actual length can vary. For example, one month can have 28, 29, 30, or 31 days depending on which month it is and whether it's a leap year. However, relative durations are very useful for representing things that occur on a regular calendar basis, such as recurring events or deadlines that are postponed by a certain number of weeks or months."}, {"human": "How would I use a relative duration in EdgeDB? Do you have an example?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have an event management system and you want to represent an event that recurs every month. You could use `cal::relative_duration` to define the interval between occurrences. Here's a simple example using SDL to define an Event type with a recurring interval:\n\n```sdl\ntype Event {\n  required name: str;\n  start_time: datetime;\n  recurring_interval: cal::relative_duration;\n}\n```\n\nIn this schema, `recurring_interval` is a property of type `cal::relative_duration` that could be set to '1 month' to indicate that the event recurs monthly."}, {"human": "What if I want to postpone an event by two weeks using EdgeQL?", "assistant": "To postpone an event by two weeks, you would add a `cal::relative_duration` of two weeks to the current `start_time` of the event. Here's how you could write that in EdgeQL:\n\n```edgeql\nUPDATE Event\nSET {\n  start_time := .start_time + <cal::relative_duration>'2 weeks'\n}\nWHERE .name = 'Annual Conference';\n```\n\nThis EdgeQL query finds the event named 'Annual Conference' and updates its `start_time` by adding two weeks to it."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use parameters in EdgeQL queries. Can you explain how that works?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeQL, you can reference parameters in your queries using the `$` notation. These parameters are placeholders for values that you supply from outside the query. For example, if you want to select a variable, you can write a query like `select $var;`. The actual value of `$var` is provided when you execute the query."}, {"human": "I see. Can you show me an example with a mathematical operation?", "assistant": "Of course! If you want to perform a mathematical operation using parameters, you can write a query like this: `select $a + $b;`. When you run this query, you'll provide the values for `$a` and `$b`, and EdgeDB will compute the sum of those two values."}, {"human": "What about using parameters to filter data in a query?", "assistant": "To filter data using a parameter, you can write a query that includes a condition with the parameter. For example, if you want to select a blog post with a specific ID, you could use a query like this: `select BlogPost filter .id = $blog_id;`. When executing the query, you supply the value for `$blog_id`, which filters the BlogPost entries to the one with the matching ID."}, {"human": "Got it. But do I need to specify the type of the parameter?", "assistant": "Yes, you need to provide an explicit type cast before the parameter. This is required so that EdgeDB can enforce the type of the provided value. For instance, if `$blog_id` is supposed to be a UUID, you would write the query like this: `select BlogPost filter .id = <uuid>$blog_id;`. The `<uuid>` part ensures that the value for `$blog_id` is treated as a UUID."}]}

In the EdgeDB REPL, you can include parameter references in your queries. When you do, the REPL will prompt you to provide a value for each parameter before executing the query. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you want to concatenate a string with a variable in EdgeQL.

Once you provide the value, for example 'EdgeDB', and press Enter, the REPL will complete the query with the provided value and display the result. In this case, it would output: `{'I \u2764\ufe0f EdgeDB!'}`."}, {"human": "That's pretty cool. Can I provide multiple values for a parameter?", "assistant": "The example provided is for a single value, but if your query is designed to accept multiple values for a parameter, you can certainly do that as well.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how parameters work in EdgeDB. Can you explain a bit about the types of parameters I can use?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, parameters are values that you can pass to queries. Prior to EdgeDB 3.0, you could only use scalar types or arrays of scalar types as parameters. Scalar types include things like integers, strings, and booleans."}, {"human": "What about EdgeDB 3.0? Did something change with the types of parameters I can use?", "assistant": "Yes, in EdgeDB 3.0, there was an update to the parameter types. Now, you can also use tuples as parameters. Tuples are ordered collections of elements, which can be a mix of different types."}, {"human": "I see. What if I need to pass more complex structures as parameters?", "assistant": "For more complex structures, you can use EdgeDB's built-in JSON functionality. JSON can represent nested structures, so it's suitable for passing complex data as parameters to your queries."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use JSON parameters in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example where we use a JSON parameter to insert data into a `Movie` type.

For instance, it could look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Inception\",\n  \"release_year\": 2010\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I actually pass this JSON object when I run the query?", "assistant": "When you execute the query, you would provide the JSON object as an argument to the `$data` parameter. The exact way to do this depends on the client or tool you're using to interact with EdgeDB. Typically, you'd use a function or method that allows you to execute a query with parameters."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use optional parameters in EdgeQL. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeQL, when you define a query parameter, it is `required` by default. This means that the query will fail if you don't provide a value for the parameter. However, if you want to allow a parameter to be optional, you can use the `optional` modifier inside the type cast. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say you have a query where you want to select a user by their name, but you want to allow the possibility of not providing a name. Here's how you can define the query with an optional parameter:\n```edgeql\nselect User {\n    name,\n    email\n} filter .name = <str>$name;\n```\nTo make the `$name` parameter optional, you modify the type cast like this:\n```edgeql\nselect User {\n    name,\n    email\n} filter .name = <optional str>$name;\n```\nNow, if you don't provide a value for `$name`, the query will not fail. Instead, it will return all users because the filter condition will not be applied."}, {"human": "What happens if I run the query without providing a value for the optional parameter?", "assistant": "If you run the query without providing a value for the optional parameter, EdgeQL treats the empty set `{}` as the value for that parameter. In the context of our example, if `$name` is not provided, the filter condition `.name = <optional str>$name` will not filter out any users, and you'll get a list of all users in the database. Here's how you might execute the query in the EdgeQL REPL:\n```edgeql-repl\ndb> select User {\n    name,\n    email\n} filter .name = <optional str>$name;\nParameter $name (Ctrl+D for empty set `{}`): {}\n```\nBy pressing Ctrl+D, you're effectively passing an empty set as the value for `$name`, which makes the filter condition evaluate to `True` for all users."}, {"human": "Is there anything else I should know about using optional parameters?", "assistant": "One thing to note is that the `optional` modifier can be used with any type cast, not just strings. So, if you have a parameter that's supposed to be an integer, a boolean, or any other type, you can still make it optional by using `<optional type>`. Also, remember that when a parameter is optional and not provided, it behaves as if the filter condition using that parameter is not present at all. This can be very useful for building flexible queries that can handle different filtering criteria based on user input."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use default parameter values in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, when you're working with optional parameters, you might want to have a fallback or default value in case the parameter isn't provided. You can achieve this by using the `??` operator, which is known as the coalesce operator."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use this coalesce operator?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a query where you want to concatenate a greeting with a name, but you also want to have a default value in case the name isn't provided. Here's how you could write that query:\n```edgeql\nselect 'Hello ' ++ $name ?? 'there';\n```\nIn this example, if `$name` is not provided, the result will be `'Hello there'`."}, {"human": "What happens if I do provide a value for the parameter?", "assistant": "If you provide a value for the parameter, the coalesce operator will use that value instead of the default. For example, if you run the query and provide 'EdgeDB' as the value for `$name`, the result will be:\n```edgeql\n{'Hello EdgeDB'}\n```\nThis is because the provided value takes precedence over the default value specified after the `??` operator."}, {"human": "Is there a way to test this in an interactive session?", "assistant": "Yes, you can test this in an EdgeDB REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) session. When you run the query in the REPL, it will prompt you to enter a value for the parameter `$name`. If you press `Ctrl+D`, it will use the default value. Here's how it might look in a REPL session:\n```edgeql-repl\ndb> select 'Hello ' ++ $name ?? 'there';\nParameter $name (Ctrl+D for empty set `{}`): EdgeDB\n{'Hello EdgeDB'}\n```\nIn this session, the user entered 'EdgeDB' when prompted for `$name`, and the output was the customized greeting with the provided name."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what parts of a query I can parameterize in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can parameterize any Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement, which includes `select`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete` commands."}, {"human": "So, can I use parameters for anything in those statements?", "assistant": "Parameters can be used for scalars, arrays of scalars, and as of EdgeDB 3.0, tuples of scalars. This means you can parameterize parts of the query that would be one of those types."}, {"human": "Could you give me an example of how to parameterize a select statement?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you want to select movies with a certain title. You could write a parameterized `select` statement like this:\n\n```edgedb\nselect Movie filter .title = <str>$title;\n```"}, {"human": "And what about inserting data with parameters?", "assistant": "When inserting data, you can use parameters for the scalar values you're inserting. Here's an example:\n\n```edgedb\ninsert Movie {\n  title := <str>$title,\n  release_year := <int16>$release_year\n};\n```"}, {"human": "Is there a way to use parameters for updating data?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use parameters in an `update` statement as well. For instance:\n\n```edgedb\nupdate Movie\nset {\n  release_year := <int16>$new_release_year\n}\nfilter .title = <str>$title;\n```"}, {"human": "And for deleting?", "assistant": "Similar to the other statements, you can use parameters in a `delete` statement to specify which records to delete. Here's how you might do it:\n\n```edgedb\ndelete Movie\nfilter .title = <str>$title;\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So, I can't use parameters for things like table names or column names, right?", "assistant": "That's correct. Parameters are intended for values like strings, numbers, and tuples of these types, not for database schema elements like table names or column names."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how EdgeDB handles operations with multiple arguments. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, when you perform element-wise operations with multiple arguments, the operation is applied to the cartesian product of all the input sets. This means that each element from the first set is paired with each element from the second set, and the operation is applied to each pair."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how that works?", "assistant": "Sure, let's take string concatenation as an example. If you have two sets of strings and you want to concatenate each string from the first set with each string from the second set, you would use the '++' operator. Here's how it looks in EdgeQL:\n```edgeql\nselect {'aaa', 'bbb'} ++ {'ccc', 'ddd'};\n```\nThe result of this operation would be a set containing 'aaaccc', 'aaaddd', 'bbbccc', and 'bbbddd'."}, {"human": "I see, so it combines every possible pair. But what if that's not the behavior I want?", "assistant": "In cases where you don't want to combine every possible pair, you would need to structure your query differently to specify how you want the elements to be combined. For example, you might use subqueries, filters, or other EdgeQL features to control the pairing of elements. If you have a specific scenario in mind, I can help you write a query that achieves the desired result."}, {"human": "What if I just want to concatenate corresponding elements from two sets, like the first with the first, and the second with the second?", "assistant": "EdgeDB doesn't have a built-in operator for 'zip'-like concatenation of two sets. However, you can achieve this by using a combination of array unpacking and the array_agg function to create an array of pairs, and then concatenate the elements of each pair. It's a bit more complex and would require a custom function or a more involved query. If you need help with that, I can guide you through the process."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how scopes work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, scopes determine how path resolution works. When you have two select queries that are siblings, meaning they are at the same level, the paths they use are resolved independently, even if they reference the same symbol. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Alright, let's consider we have a type `User` with properties `first_name` and `last_name`. If we run two sibling select queries to get the `first_name` and `last_name` of users, it would look like this:\n```edgeql\nedgedb> select ((select User.first_name), (select User.last_name));\n{\n  ('Mina', 'Murray'),\n  ('Mina', 'Harker'),\n  ('Mina', 'Westenra'),\n  ...\n}\n```Each `select` is independent, so the `User.first_name` and `User.last_name` are fetched separately for each user, and the results are combined into pairs."}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So the queries don't share the same context?", "assistant": "Exactly! Each sibling select query creates its own context for path resolution. They don't share or factor in the paths even if they are using the same symbol, like `User` in this case. This is important to understand when constructing complex queries, as it affects how the data is retrieved and combined."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! That clears up my confusion.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand what a path expression is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a path expression, or simply a path, is a way to represent a set of values that you can reach by following a sequence of links or properties starting from a certain set of objects. It's like navigating a map from one point to another through specific routes."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example based on a schema?", "assistant": "Sure, let's consider a simple schema with two types: User and BlogPost. Here's how it looks in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype User {\n  required email: str;\n  multi friends: User;\n}\n\ntype BlogPost {\n  required title: str;\n  required author: User;\n}\n``\nIn this schema, a User has an email and can have multiple friends, which are also Users. A BlogPost has a title and an author, which is linked to a User."}, {"human": "How would I use a path to find the email addresses of a user's friends?", "assistant": "To find the email addresses of a user's friends, you would start with a User object and traverse the 'friends' link, then access the 'email' property. In EdgeQL, the query would look like this:\n```edgedb\nSELECT User.friends.email;\n```\nThis path expression starts with the User type, follows the 'friends' link to get the user's friends, and then retrieves the 'email' property of those friend User objects."}, {"human": "What if I wanted to get the titles of all blog posts written by a user's friends?", "assistant": "To get the titles of all blog posts written by a user's friends, you would extend the path to traverse from the User to their friends, then to the BlogPosts authored by those friends, and finally select the title of those BlogPosts. The EdgeQL query would be:\n```edgedb\nSELECT User.friends.<author[IS BlogPost].title;\n```\nThis path goes from User to their friends, uses the inverse link '<author' to find BlogPosts where the friends are authors, checks that those are indeed BlogPosts with '[IS BlogPost]', and then selects the 'title' property."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use backlinks in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, backlinks allow you to traverse relationships in the reverse direction. Normally, when you define a link between two types, you can query from one type to another following the direction of the link. Backlinks let you start from the target of the link and find all the sources that point to it using the `.<` notation."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use backlinks in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a type `User` and a type `Post` where each `Post` has an `author` link to a `User`. If you want to find all posts written by a particular user, you would normally traverse the `author` link from `Post` to `User`. But if you want to find all users who have written a particular post, you would use a backlink. Here's how you can write that query in EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nselect User.<author[IS Post];\n``` \nThis query selects all `User` objects that are the authors of any `Post`."}, {"human": "What if I want to select all posts and also see the users who authored them using backlinks?", "assistant": "To achieve that, you can use a backlink in a subquery. Here's an example that selects all posts and includes the users who authored them: \n```edgeql\nselect Post {\n    title,\n    author: {\n        name\n    },\n    authors := .<author[IS User].name\n};\n``` \nThis query selects each `Post`, its `title`, the `author`'s `name`, and also includes a computed property `authors` that uses a backlink to get the names of the users who authored the post."}, {"human": "Is there a way to filter the results based on the backlink traversal?", "assistant": "Yes, you can filter the results by adding a condition after the backlink traversal. For example, if you want to find all posts authored by users with a specific name, you could write: \n```edgeql\nselect Post {\n    title,\n    author: {\n        name\n    }\n} filter .<author[IS User].name = 'Alice';\n``` \nThis query will return all `Post` objects where the backlinked `User` has the name 'Alice'."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to query objects that are linked to a user in EdgeDB. Can you explain how to do that?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can query objects that are linked to a specific user by using a link property in your query. For example, if you want to find all objects that link to the user via a link named 'author', you would use the following syntax: `User.<author`. This query will return all objects where the 'author' link points to a User instance."}, {"human": "I see, but I'm not sure I understand the syntax `User.<author`. Can you break it down for me?", "assistant": "Of course! The syntax `User.<author` can be broken down into two parts: \n- `User.<` indicates that you're looking for objects that link to the 'User' type. \nThe `<` symbol is used to denote the reverse direction of the link, meaning you're starting from 'User' and looking for objects that link to it. \n- `author` is the name of the link you're interested in. So when you put them together, `User.<author` means 'find all objects that have a link named 'author' pointing to a User instance'."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! Can you show me an example of how this would look in an actual query?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a type 'Article' that has an 'author' link to the 'User' type. If you want to find all articles written by a specific user, your EdgeQL query would look like this: \n```edgedb\nSELECT User.<author[IS Article] {\n    title,\n    content\n}\nFILTER User.id = <user_id>;\n``` \nIn this query, replace `<user_id>` with the actual ID of the user you're interested in. This will select the 'title' and 'content' of all 'Article' objects where the 'author' link points to the user with the specified ID."}, {"human": "That makes sense. And if I wanted to find all types of objects linked to the user, not just articles?", "assistant": "If you want to find all types of objects linked to the user, you can omit the type filter in the query. Here's how you would write it: \n```edgedb\nSELECT User.<author {\n    # Here you can specify the properties you want to select,\n    # or use '*' to select all properties.\n}\nFILTER User.id = <user_id>;\n``` \nThis query will return all objects linked to the user via the 'author' link, regardless of their type. Just remember to replace `<user_id>` with the actual ID of the user you're querying for."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use link properties in EdgeDB. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can add properties to links between objects. This is useful when you want to store additional information about the relationship itself. For example, if you have a `User` type with a `friends` link to other `User` objects, you might want to store the date since they became friends. You can do this by defining a property on the `friends` link."}, {"human": "That sounds useful. How do I add a property to a link?", "assistant": "You can add a property to a link by including a block with the property definition inside the link definition. Here's how you would add a `since` property of type `cal::local_date` to the `friends` link in the `User` type:"}, {"human": "Can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the SDL difference showing how to add the `since` property to the `friends` link:"}, {"human": "Great, let me see the SDL code.", "assistant": "```sdl\n type User {\n   required email: str;\n - multi friends: User;\n + multi friends: User {\n +   since: cal::local_date;\n + }\n }\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I query this new link property?", "assistant": "To query the link property, you can use the `@` notation in your EdgeQL queries. For example, if you want to get a set of all dates on which a specific user became friends with other users, you could write a query like this:"}, {"human": "Please show me the query.", "assistant": "```edgeql\nSELECT User.friends@since;\n```"}, {"human": "That's clear now. Thanks for your help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about path roots in EdgeQL. Can you explain what they are with an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeQL, a path root is the starting point of a query path. It's the expression that specifies the set of items you're interested in. Typically, you might start with a simple type name like `User`, but the root can actually be any expression that returns object types, including subqueries. Would you like to see an example using a subquery as a path root?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example with a subquery.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say we have a blog platform and we want to find all the blog posts with a title that includes 'EdgeDB is awesome'. We can use a subquery as the root of our path to filter these posts. Here's how you might write that query in EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nwith edgedb_lovers := (\n    select BlogPost\n    filter .title ilike '%EdgeDB is awesome%'\n)\nselect edgedb_lovers {\n    title,\n    content\n}\n``` \nIn this example, `edgedb_lovers` is a subquery that selects blog posts with a certain title. We then use `edgedb_lovers` as the root for the main `select` statement to get the titles and contents of those posts."}, {"human": "What does the `%` symbol mean in the `ilike` operator?", "assistant": "The `%` symbol is a wildcard in EdgeQL that represents any sequence of characters. It's used with the `ilike` operator to perform case-insensitive pattern matching. In the query example, `ilike '%EdgeDB is awesome%'` will match any title that contains the phrase 'EdgeDB is awesome' regardless of case, and the `%` symbols mean that there can be any characters before or after the phrase."}, {"human": "Got it! Can we use other expressions as path roots as well?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can use a variety of expressions as path roots. For example, you could use a function call that returns object types, or even a more complex subquery involving joins. The key is that the root expression must return a set of objects that you can then traverse or filter further in your query. If you have a specific scenario in mind, I can help you craft a query for it."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the 'select' command in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Absolutely! The 'select' command in EdgeDB is used to retrieve or compute a set of values. It's quite versatile and can be used for simple queries as well as more complex ones with additional clauses. Would you like to see some basic examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some simple examples of using 'select'.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here are a few simple queries using 'select':\n\n```edgeql\nselect 'hello world';  # This will return the string 'hello world'\n\nselect [1, 2, 3];  # This will return an array of integers [1, 2, 3]\n\nselect {1, 2, 3};  # This will return a set of integers {1, 2, 3}\n```\n\nIn the EdgeDB REPL, you would see the results as shown in the comments. The first query returns a single string, the second returns an array, and the third returns a set of distinct elements."}, {"human": "What if I want to filter or sort the results? How would I do that?", "assistant": "To filter or sort your results, you can use a `with` block along with your `select` statement. The `with` block allows you to define variables and expressions that you can then use in your `select` statement for filtering (`filter`), ordering (`order by`), and pagination (`limit`, `offset`). Would you like to see an example that includes a filter and an order by clause?"}, {"human": "Yes, an example with a filter and sorting would be great.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say we have a type `Person` with properties `name` and `age`. If we want to select persons over the age of 30 and order them by name, the query would look like this:\n\n```edgeql\nwith\n  Adult as (\n    select Person\n    filter .age > 30\n  )\nselect Adult {\n  name,\n  age\n}\norder by .name;\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `with` block where `Adult` is a variable representing all `Person` entries with an `age` greater than 30. Then we `select` from `Adult` and order the results by the `name` property."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to select objects in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course!

Now, let's write a query to select some objects."}, {"human": "I see. How would I select all heroes from the database?", "assistant": "To select all heroes, you would use a query like this:\n```\nSELECT Hero;\n```This query fetches all objects of type `Hero` from the database."}, {"human": "What if I only want to select heroes with a specific name?", "assistant": "If you're looking for heroes with a specific name, you can add a filter to your query. For example, to select heroes named 'Batman', you would write:\n```\nSELECT Hero\nWHERE Hero.name = 'Batman';\n```This query selects all `Hero` objects where the `name` property is equal to 'Batman'."}, {"human": "Got it. And how can I select a hero along with their secret identity?", "assistant": "To select a hero and include their secret identity in the results, you can specify the properties you want to retrieve, like this:\n```\nSELECT Hero {\n  name,\n  secret_identity\n};\n```This query will return the `name` and `secret_identity` for each `Hero` object."}, {"human": "That's really helpful.

Happy querying!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how pagination works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can paginate through a set of results using the `limit` and `offset` clauses. These are often used together with `order by` to ensure that the ordering of the results is consistent across different pages of data."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use these clauses?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a list of villains and you want to retrieve them in alphabetical order, but you only want the third and fourth entries. You would use a query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Villain {\n  name\n}\norder by .name\noffset 2\nlimit 2;\n```"}, {"human": "What does the 'offset 2' part do?", "assistant": "The `offset 2` clause skips the first two results. So if you're paginating, it means you're starting from the third item in the ordered list."}, {"human": "And the 'limit 2' part?", "assistant": "The `limit 2` clause specifies that after the offset, you want to retrieve only the next two results. So together with `offset 2`, you're getting the third and fourth items in the list."}, {"human": "I see. So if I wanted the next two villains after that, would I just increase the offset?", "assistant": "Exactly! If you wanted the fifth and sixth villains, you would use `offset 4` to skip the first four and then `limit 2` to get the next two. Like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Villain {\n  name\n}\norder by .name\noffset 4\nlimit 2;\n```"}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I've heard about computed fields in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are?", "assistant": "Certainly! Computed fields in EdgeDB are EdgeQL expressions that are calculated on the fly when you execute a query. They're not stored in the database but are computed at the time of the query, based on other values in the database."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use a computed field in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a `Villain` type and you want to include a computed field that concatenates the villain's first and last name. Here's how you might write that query:\n```edgeql\nselect Villain {\n  full_name := .first_name ++ ' ' ++ .last_name,\n  # other fields...\n}\n```In this example, `full_name` is a computed field that combines `first_name` and `last_name` with a space in between."}, {"human": "What does the dot notation like `.first_name` mean?", "assistant": "The leading dot notation, such as `.first_name`, is used to refer to the properties and links of the object type that is currently in scope. In the context of our query, `.first_name` refers to the `first_name` property of the `Villain` type we are selecting."}, {"human": "Is there a limit to the complexity of computed fields?", "assistant": "Computed fields can be quite flexible and can include various EdgeQL expressions. However, the complexity is limited by what can be computed on-the-fly during query execution.

The `<` operator is used to traverse the link in the reverse direction."}, {"human": "I see. So the `<characters` part is doing the backlink fetching, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `<characters` syntax indicates that we're interested in the reverse direction of the `characters` link. By adding `[is Movie]`, we're specifying that we only want to traverse this link in the context of `Movie` objects. This way, we get all the `Movie` objects that are linked to our `Hero` through the `characters` link."}, {"human": "Got it. And what does the `{ title }` part do?", "assistant": "The `{ title }` part is a shape that specifies which properties of the linked `Movie` objects we want to include in the result. In this case, we're only interested in the `title` of each movie. If you wanted more properties, you could expand the shape accordingly."}, {"human": "Makes sense.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand subqueries in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, subqueries allow you to embed entire queries inside other queries. This is useful when you want to compute values that require more complex operations or when you want to retrieve related data. EdgeQL, the query language for EdgeDB, is designed to be fully composable, which means you can build up queries in a modular way."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of a subquery?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a `Villain` type in your database, and each villain has a `nemesis` and may be associated with various `movies`.

The subquery is the part within the parentheses. It's a complete query on its own, but it's used here to compute a property of the `Villain` type. The subquery filters `Movie` instances based on whether their `actors` include the villain's nemesis. The result of this subquery is then assigned to the `movies_with_nemesis` computed property."}, {"human": "What does the '.nemesis.name' part mean?", "assistant": "The `.nemesis.name` part is a path expression. It starts with a dot `.` which refers to the current `Villain` instance being selected. Then it follows the `nemesis` link to get the related `nemesis` object, and finally, it retrieves the `name` property of that `nemesis` object. So, `.nemesis.name` gives you the name of the nemesis for each villain."}, {"human": "Got it! And how does the filter work in the subquery?", "assistant": "The `filter` clause in the subquery is used to specify a condition that the selected `Movie` instances must satisfy. In this case, `filter .actors.name = .nemesis.name` means that we only want to select movies where at least one of the actors has the same name as the villain's nemesis. The filter compares the `name` property of each actor in the `actors` link set of a `Movie` with the `name` property of the `nemesis` of the current `Villain`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how polymorphism works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, polymorphism allows you to work with a set of objects that may be instances of different types, as long as they share a common ancestor type. For example, if you have a `Person` type with subtypes `Hero` and `Villain`, you can query all `Person` objects and the result will include both `Hero` and `Villain` objects, as well as any other subtypes of `Person`."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to query for all `Person` objects?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an EdgeQL query that selects all `Person` objects and retrieves their names:\n```edgeql\nselect Person {\n  name\n};\n```This query will return a set that includes objects of type `Hero`, `Villain`, and any other subtypes of `Person` that might exist in the database, each with their `name` property."}, {"human": "What would the result look like if I had some `Hero` and `Villain` objects in the database?", "assistant": "If you had some `Hero` and `Villain` objects in your database, the result of the query might look something like this:\n```edgeql\n{\n  default::Hero {name: 'Spider-Man'},\n  default::Hero {name: 'Iron Man'},\n  default::Villain {name: 'Green Goblin'},\n  // ... possibly more objects\n}\n```Each object is labeled with its specific type, like `default::Hero` or `default::Villain`, along with the value of the `name` property."}, {"human": "Does this mean I can also filter or sort based on properties of the `Person` type?", "assistant": "Yes, exactly! Since `Hero` and `Villain` are subtypes of `Person`, they inherit all properties of `Person`. You can filter, sort, and perform other operations on the `Person` set based on these shared properties. For instance, if you want to get all `Person` objects with a name that starts with 'S', you could write:\n```edgeql\nselect Person {\n  name\n}\nfilter .name like 'S%';\n```And if you wanted to sort them by name, you could add an `order by` clause:\n```edgeql\nselect Person {\n  name\n}\norder by .name;\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand polymorphic queries in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, polymorphic queries allow you to fetch different properties based on the subtype of each object. This is done by using the `[is <Type>]` syntax in front of the property or link references. When you use this syntax, you're essentially asking EdgeDB to only consider the property or link if the object is of the specified subtype."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use this in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a `Person` type and a `Hero` subtype that extends `Person`. If `Hero` has a `secret_identity` property and a `villains` link, you can write a query to select `Person` objects and conditionally fetch `secret_identity` and the count of `villains` only for those `Person` objects that are also `Hero` objects. Here's how you would write it:"}, {"human": "Okay, show me the code.", "assistant": "Here's the EdgeQL query you would use:\n```edgeql\nselect Person {\n  name,\n  secret_identity := [is Hero].secret_identity,\n  number_of_villains := count([is Hero].villains)\n}\n```In this query, `secret_identity` and `number_of_villains` are only fetched for `Person` objects that are also `Hero` objects. If a `Person` is not a `Hero`, these fields will be `None` or `0` respectively."}, {"human": "What happens if a Person is not a Hero?", "assistant": "If a `Person` is not a `Hero`, the `secret_identity` field in the result will be `None` because the property does not exist on the base `Person` type. Similarly, `number_of_villains` will be `0` since there are no `villains` linked to a non-`Hero` `Person`. The query will not fail; it will simply return default values for those fields."}, {"human": "That's pretty neat. Can I use this polymorphic query feature with any type and subtype?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use polymorphic queries with any type and its subtypes in EdgeDB. Just remember to use the `[is <Subtype>]` syntax to specify which subtype's properties or links you want to access in your query."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to filter polymorphic links in EdgeDB. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can have links that point to multiple types, which are known as polymorphic links. If you want to filter these links to only include objects of a certain subtype, you can use the `is` operator. Would you like to see an example of how to do this?"}, {"human": "Yes, an example would be great!", "assistant": "Alright, let's say you have a `Movie` type that has a polymorphic link called `characters` which can point to different character types, including `Hero`. If you want to select only the `Hero` characters from the `Movie`'s `characters` link, you can use the following EdgeQL query:\n\n```edgeql\nselect Movie {\n  title,\n  characters[is Hero] {\n    secret_identity\n  }\n};\n```\n\nIn this query, `characters[is Hero]` filters the `characters` link to only include objects that are of type `Hero`. The `{ secret_identity }` part specifies that we want to fetch the `secret_identity` property of those `Hero` objects."}, {"human": "What if I also want to get the name of the hero along with the secret identity?", "assistant": "You can simply add the `name` property to the selection set for the `Hero` type. Here's how you would modify the query:\n\n```edgeql\nselect Movie {\n  title,\n  characters[is Hero] {\n    name,\n    secret_identity\n  }\n};\n```\n\nNow, the query will return both the `name` and `secret_identity` of each `Hero` associated with the `Movie`."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if the `characters` link includes other types like `Villain` and I want to fetch them as well?", "assistant": "If you want to fetch characters of another type, such as `Villain`, you can add another filtered link in the same query. Here's an example that fetches both `Hero` and `Villain` characters:\n\n```edgeql\nselect Movie {\n  title,\n  characters[is Hero] {\n    name,\n    secret_identity\n  },\n  characters[is Villain] {\n    name,\n    evil_plan\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThis query will return the `name` and `secret_identity` for `Hero` characters, and the `name` and `evil_plan` for `Villain` characters, all within the context of their associated `Movie`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to run a polymorphic query in EdgeDB and I want to access the type of each object in the results. How can I do that?", "assistant": "In EdgeDB, when you run polymorphic queries in the REPL, the type of each object is displayed alongside the results for convenience. However, this type information is not actually a property of the objects that you can access directly in your queries."}, {"human": "So, there's no way to get the type information at all?", "assistant": "If you need to access the type information within a query, you can use the `__type__` pseudo-link. This allows you to retrieve the name of the type for each object. Here's an example of how you might use it:"}, {"human": "Could you show me an example query using `__type__`?", "assistant": "Certainly! Let's say you have a polymorphic query that fetches different types of shapes. You can use `__type__` to get the type name like this:\n\n```\nSELECT Shape {\n    __type__ -> name,\n    ... # other properties or links\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What happens if I cast the results to JSON? Will I still see the type?", "assistant": "When you cast an object to `json`, the type information is not included in the output. This means you won't be able to determine the type of the object from the JSON result alone. If you need the type information to be present in the JSON, you would have to explicitly include it in your query before casting to JSON."}, {"human": "How would I include the type information in a JSON result then?", "assistant": "To include the type information in a JSON result, you can construct a JSON object within your query and include the type name as part of that object. Here's an example:\n\n```\nSELECT to_json({\n    type_name := Shape.__type__ -> name,\n    ... # other properties or links\n});\n```"}, {"human": "Thanks, that helps a lot! I'll try that in my queries.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance with your queries, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand what a 'free object' is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a 'free object' allows you to select several values simultaneously by bundling them into an object that consists of key-value pairs. These pairs can contain any expression. The term 'free' means that this object isn't an instance of a predefined object type, but rather it's constructed on-the-fly within a query."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use a free object in a query?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you want to select a movie's title and release year without retrieving the whole movie object. You can use a free object to do this. Here's an example query:\n\n```edgeql\nSELECT { title: movie.title, release_year: movie.release_year } FILTER movie.title = 'Inception';\n```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So, the keys in the free object are the names I want to use in the result, and the values are the expressions to get the data?", "assistant": "Exactly! The keys in the free object are the names you assign to the results, and the values are the expressions that fetch or compute the data you want to include in those results. This way, you can create a custom-shaped result that includes only the data you need."}, {"human": "Is it possible to include computations in a free object?", "assistant": "Yes, you can include computations in a free object. For example, if you want to get a movie's title and calculate the number of years since its release, you could write a query like this:\n\n```edgeql\nSELECT { title: movie.title, years_since_release: datetime_current() - movie.release_year } FILTER movie.title = 'Inception';\n```"}, {"human": "That's really useful. Thanks for helping me understand free objects!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what shapes are in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a shape is a way to specify which properties or links of an object you want to select in a query. You can attach a shape to any object type expression in EdgeQL, which is the query language for EdgeDB. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of how to use shapes.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you have a type called `Villain` and you want to select only the `id` and `name` properties of all villains in your database. You can use a shape to do this. Here's how the EdgeQL query would look:\n```edgeql\nselect Villain {\n  id,\n  name\n};\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return a set of `Villain` objects, each with only the `id` and `name` properties included in the result."}, {"human": "What does the output look like when I use shapes?", "assistant": "The output will include the specified properties for each object in a structured format. For example, if you run the query I showed you, the output might look something like this:\n```edgeql\n{\n  default::Villain {id: '6c22bdf0...', name: 'Sandman'},\n  default::Villain {id: '6c22c3d6...', name: 'Electro'},\n  default::Villain {id: '6c22c46c...', name: 'Another Villain'}\n}\n```\nEach `Villain` object in the set is represented with its `id` and `name` as specified in the shape."}, {"human": "Can I include relationships in a shape as well?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In addition to properties, you can include links (relationships) in a shape. If a `Villain` has a link to a `Hideout`, for example, you can select the villain's name and the name of their hideout like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Villain {\n  name,\n  hideout: {\n    name\n  }\n};\n```\nThis query will return villains with their names and the names of their hideouts. The shape for the `hideout` link is nested within the shape for `Villain`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the 'with' block in EdgeQL. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! The 'with' block in EdgeQL allows you to declare standalone expressions that you can then use within your query. It's a way to create variables or aliases for expressions that you want to reuse in the query that follows the 'with' block."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a type called 'Hero' and you want to select a hero whose name is 'Iron Man'. You can use the 'with' block to declare a variable for the name and then use it in your filter condition. Here's how it looks:\n```edgeql\nwith hero_name := 'Iron Man'\nselect Hero {\n  secret_identity\n}\nfilter .name = hero_name;\n```"}, {"human": "What does the '.' mean before 'name' in the filter condition?", "assistant": "The dot '.' before 'name' in the filter condition is used to refer to the current element being selected, which in this case is an instance of 'Hero'. It's similar to 'this' or 'self' in other programming languages. So '.name' is referring to the 'name' property of the current 'Hero' instance."}, {"human": "Got it! And can I use the 'with' block with other types of queries, like 'update' or 'delete'?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use the 'with' block with other top-level EdgeQL statements such as 'select', 'insert', 'update', and 'delete'. It's a versatile feature that can be used to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into more manageable parts."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example with an 'update' statement?", "assistant": "Certainly! Let's say you want to update the secret identity of 'Iron Man' to 'Tony Stark'. You can use the 'with' block to declare the hero's name and the new secret identity, and then use those in your 'update' statement like this:\n```edgeql\nwith\n  hero_name := 'Iron Man',\n  new_identity := 'Tony Stark'\nupdate Hero\nset {\n  secret_identity = new_identity\n}\nfilter .name = hero_name;\n```"}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks!

What happens if there are duplicates in the sets?", "assistant": "When using the 'except' operator, if there are duplicates in the sets, they will be treated as a single instance. So, if a common member is repeated in both sets, it will be eliminated completely from the result. The 'except' operator doesn't count occurrences; it only considers the presence of elements in the sets."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeQL or anything else related to EdgeDB, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to write a query in EdgeDB but I'm not sure how to handle empty sets. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can handle empty sets by using the coalescing operator `??`. It allows you to provide a default value in case a set is empty. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's a simple example using the EdgeQL REPL:\n```edgeql\nselect 'value' ?? 'default';\n-- output: {'value'}\n\nselect {} ?? 'default';\n-- output: {'default'}\n```In the first query, since the set is not empty, it returns 'value'. In the second query, the set is empty, so it returns 'default'."}, {"human": "I see. So the coalescing operator is like a fallback option for when the first part is empty?", "assistant": "Exactly! The coalescing operator `??` provides a fallback value when the left-hand side evaluates to an empty set. It's quite handy for setting default values or ensuring that a query returns something even when the expected data is missing."}, {"human": "Can I use this with query parameters that might be optional?", "assistant": "Yes, that's one of the common uses for the coalescing operator. If you have an optional query parameter, you can use `??` to provide a default value in case the parameter isn't provided. Here's a hypothetical example:\n```edgeql\nselect User { name, age } filter .age > <int64>$min_age ?? 18;\n```In this query, if `$min_age` is not provided, it will default to 18."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how inheritance works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of types, where one type can extend the properties and links of another. This is similar to how classes work in object-oriented programming. You can define an abstract type, which serves as a template, and then create other types that inherit from this abstract type."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to define an abstract type and other types that inherit from it?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a general category called `Media`, which has a property `title`. You can define it as an abstract type because it's a concept rather than something you'd instantiate directly. Then, you can have specific media types like `Movie` and `TVShow` that extend the `Media` type and inherit its `title` property. Here's how you might define it in SDL:\n```sdl\nabstract type Media {\n  required title: str;\n}\n\ntype Movie extending Media {\n  release_year: int64;\n}\n\ntype TVShow extending Media {\n  // TVShow specific properties would go here\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So `Movie` and `TVShow` will both have the `title` property from `Media`?", "assistant": "Exactly! Both `Movie` and `TVShow` will inherit the `title` property from `Media`, and you can also add additional properties specific to each type. For instance, `Movie` has a `release_year` property. If `TVShow` had specific properties like `number_of_episodes`, you would define those within the `TVShow` type."}, {"human": "What if I want to create an instance of `Movie`? Do I need to specify the `title`?", "assistant": "Yes, when you create an instance of `Movie`, you must provide a value for the `title` property because it's marked as `required` in the `Media` abstract type. Additionally, you can provide values for any other properties defined in `Movie`, such as `release_year`."}, {"human": "Got it. And can `Movie` or `TVShow` extend multiple types?", "assistant": "In EdgeDB, a type can indeed extend multiple other types, allowing for a mix-in style of inheritance. However, you need to be careful with multiple inheritance to avoid conflicts and ensure that the resulting type structure makes sense for your data model."}, {"human": "Thanks for the explanation! I think I have a better grasp of inheritance in EdgeDB now.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand the difference between aggregate and element-wise operations in EdgeQL. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeQL, functions and operators can be categorized as either aggregate or element-wise. Aggregate operations take a set of values and combine them into a single result. For example, calculating the sum of a list of numbers is an aggregate operation because it combines all the numbers into one sum."}, {"human": "I see, so aggregate operations are like the SUM function in SQL. What about element-wise operations?", "assistant": "Element-wise operations, on the other hand, apply a function or operator to each individual element in a set, producing a set of results. For instance, if you have a list of numbers and you want to increase each number by 1, you would use an element-wise operation. Each number is incremented independently of the others."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you give me an example of both types of operations in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example of an aggregate operation in EdgeQL, where we calculate the average age of all people in a database:\n```\nSELECT avg(Person.age);\n```\nAnd here's an example of an element-wise operation, where we increment each person's age by 1:\n```\nSELECT Person.age + 1;\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. So when I'm writing queries, I should think about whether I'm working with individual elements or a whole set of them?", "assistant": "Exactly! It's a good mental model to have when starting out with EdgeDB. Keep in mind whether you're performing an operation on each item individually or on the set as a whole. This will help you decide which type of operation to use."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how arrays and sets work in EdgeDB. Can you explain the difference to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, both arrays and sets are collections of values that share a type. The key difference is that arrays are ordered collections where each element has a specific position, while sets are unordered and can be thought of more like a mathematical set where each element is unique and order doesn't matter."}, {"human": "So how do I convert between arrays and sets in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "EdgeQL provides ways to convert one into the other. For example, if you have a set of type `x` and you want to convert it into an array, you would use specific functions or expressions to do so. Similarly, you can convert an array into a set."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of converting a set to an array?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a set of integers `{1, 2, 3}` and you want to convert it into an array. You could use the `array_agg()` function in EdgeQL to do this. Here's how you might write the query:\n```\nSELECT array_agg({1, 2, 3});\n```\nThis would return an array `[1, 2, 3]`."}, {"human": "And what about converting an array to a set?", "assistant": "To convert an array to a set, you can simply use the array elements in a set context. For instance, if you have an array `[1, 2, 3]` and you want to treat it as a set, you could write a query like this:\n```\nWITH array := [1, 2, 3]\nSELECT {array[0], array[1], array[2]};\n```\nThis would give you a set `{1, 2, 3}`."}, {"human": "Is there anything special I need to keep in mind when working with these conversions?", "assistant": "Yes, there's an important note to remember: in EdgeQL, all values are considered sets. This means that an array literal is actually a singleton set containing one array. So when we talk about 'converting' a set into an array, we're actually talking about converting a set of type `x` into another set that contains an array of `x`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to create set literals in EdgeQL. Can you show me how it's done?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeQL, you can create set literals using curly braces `{}` with a comma-separated list of values inside. For example, if you want to create a set of strings, you can do it like this:\n```edgeql\nselect {\"set\", \"of\", \"strings\"};\n```"}, {"human": "Oh, that's pretty straightforward. What about a set of numbers?", "assistant": "Creating a set of numbers is just as simple. You use the same syntax with curly braces. Here's how you would create a set of integers:\n```edgeql\nselect {1, 2, 3};\n```"}, {"human": "Is there more to sets than just this syntax?", "assistant": "Actually, the curly braces are a syntactic sugar for the `union` operator. So when you use curly braces to create a set, you're essentially using the `union` operator to combine the values into a set. However, for most cases, using the curly braces is the easiest way to construct sets in EdgeQL."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about literals in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, literals like `6` or `'hello world'` are considered singletons. This means that they are shorthand for declaring a set that contains a single element of a given type."}, {"human": "So when I use a literal, it's actually creating a set?", "assistant": "Exactly! Every value in EdgeDB is a set, even if it's a set with just one item, which we call a singleton. When you use a literal in a query, EdgeDB treats it as a singleton set. That's why when you select a literal, the output is shown inside braces."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how this looks in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! If you were to run a query selecting the number 6, it would look like this in the EdgeDB REPL:\n```\nedgeql-repl db> select 6;\n{6}\n```\nAnd if you select the string 'hello world', it would be displayed as:\n```\nedgeql-repl db> select 'hello world';\n{'hello world'}\n```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So the braces indicate that it's a set. Does this affect how I write queries in any way?", "assistant": "For the most part, you can write queries as you normally would, and EdgeDB will handle the underlying set nature of values. However, understanding that everything is a set can be helpful when you're working with more complex queries, especially those involving set operations or when you're expecting multiple results."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how EdgeDB handles the absence of data. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the absence of data is represented by an empty set, rather than using `null` as in SQL databases. This approach eliminates the concept of `null` and its associated edge cases."}, {"human": "So, how does this work in practice? Can you give me an example?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a query that fetches the email addresses of all users. In SQL, if a user doesn't have an email address, the result might include `null`. In EdgeDB, if a user doesn't have an email address, that user simply wouldn't appear in the set of email addresses. If no users have email addresses, you'd get an empty set."}, {"human": "What's the problem with having `null` values, though?", "assistant": "The existence of `null` can be problematic because it's an edge case that affects all of SQL. It requires additional logic to handle `null` values, such as checking for `null` before performing operations, which can complicate the code and lead to potential errors."}, {"human": "Does this mean that EdgeDB doesn't have any concept similar to `null` at all?", "assistant": "That's correct. EdgeDB's design philosophy is to avoid `null` and its complications by using sets. An empty set in EdgeDB signifies that there is no data, which simplifies the handling of such cases."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what a set reference is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, a set reference is essentially a pointer to a set of values. Most commonly, it's the name of an object type that you've declared in your schema. For example, if you have a type called 'User' defined in your schema, you can use 'User' as a set reference to point to all instances of that type."}, {"human": "I see. Could you show me an example of how to use a set reference in a query?", "assistant": "Absolutely! Let's say you have a type 'User' in your schema. If you want to select all users, you would use the following EdgeQL query:\n```edgeql\nselect User;\n```\nThis would return a set of all 'User' objects. If you have two users in your database, the result might look something like this:\n```\n{\n  default::User {id: 9d2ce01c-35e8-11ec-acc3-83b1377efea0},\n  default::User {id: b0e0dd0c-35e8-11ec-acc3-abf1752973be},\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how would I count the number of users?", "assistant": "To count the number of users, you can use the 'count()' function along with the set reference like this:\n```edgeql\nselect count(User);\n```\nIf there are two users in your database, the output of this query would be:\n```\n{2}\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. So 'User' is a set reference because it refers to the set of all users in the database?", "assistant": "Exactly! 'User' is a set reference because it points to the collection of all user objects in the database. You can use set references to perform various operations on the entire set, like selecting, counting, filtering, and more."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how sets work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, sets are actually multisets, which means they can contain duplicates of the same element. So if you have a set with the same item repeated, all instances of that item will appear in the set."}, {"human": "So if I have a set with multiple 'aaa', they will all show up? How does that look in a query?", "assistant": "Exactly. If you select a set with multiple 'aaa' values, they will all be included in the result. Here's how it would look in an EdgeQL query:\n```edgeql\nselect {'aaa', 'aaa', 'aaa'};\n```\nThe result would be:\n```\n{'aaa', 'aaa', 'aaa'}\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to get rid of the duplicates?", "assistant": "To eliminate duplicates, you can use the `distinct` set operator. Here's how you would modify the query:\n```edgeql\nselect distinct {'aaa', 'aaa', 'aaa'};\n```\nAnd the result would be a set with the duplicates removed:\n```\n{'aaa'}\n```"}, {"human": "That's pretty clear now. Thanks! Is there more to learn about this?", "assistant": "You're welcome! Yes, there's always more to learn. You can explore the EdgeDB documentation for more details on set operations and other features of the EdgeQL query language."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to check if a certain value is part of a set in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `in` operator to check if a set contains a particular element. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's how you can use the `in` operator in an EdgeQL query:\n```edgeql\nselect 'aaa' in {'aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'};\n```\nThis query will return `{true}` because 'aaa' is indeed an element of the set. Conversely, if you check for an element that is not in the set, like this:\n```edgeql\nselect 'ddd' in {'aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'};\n```\nIt will return `{false}` since 'ddd' is not in the set. Does that make sense?"}, {"human": "Got it, that's pretty straightforward. Can I use this with variables or only with hardcoded sets?", "assistant": "You can definitely use it with variables as well. The `in` operator is not limited to hardcoded sets; it can be used to check membership in any set, including those that are the result of a query or stored in a variable. For example:\n```edgeql\nwith my_set := {'aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'}\nselect 'aaa' in my_set;\n```\nThis will also return `{true}` because 'aaa' is a member of `my_set`."}, {"human": "That's really useful. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or EdgeQL, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to merge sets in EdgeDB. Can you explain how the `union` operator works?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can use the `union` operator to combine two or more sets into a single set. When you use `union`, it merges the elements from all the sets and returns a set that contains all unique elements. Here's a simple example using strings:"}, {"human": "Could you show me an example?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you can merge three sets of strings using the `union` operator in an EdgeQL query:\n```edgeql\nselect 'aaa' union 'bbb' union 'ccc';\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return a set containing the strings 'aaa', 'bbb', and 'ccc'."}, {"human": "What if the sets contain different types of data, like integers and floats?", "assistant": "When merging sets with different numeric types, such as integers and floats, EdgeDB will automatically cast integers to floats to make the types compatible. Here's an example:\n```edgeql\nselect {1, 2} union {3.1, 4.4};\n```\nThis query will return a set with the numbers 1.0, 2.0, 3.1, and 4.4, with the integers cast to floats."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And all the elements in the resulting set are unique, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `union` operator will only include unique elements in the resulting set. So if there are any duplicates across the sets you're merging, they will only appear once in the final set."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to find common elements between two sets in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `intersect` operator to find common members between two sets. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example with numbers.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's how you can find common elements between two sets of numbers:\n```edgeql-repl\ndb> select {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} intersect {3, 4, 5, 6, 7};\n{3, 5, 4}\n```As you can see, the result is a set containing the numbers `{3, 5, 4}`, which are common to both sets."}, {"human": "Great, and what if I want to do the same with strings?", "assistant": "It works the same way with strings. Here's an example:\n```edgeql-repl\ndb> select {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'} intersect {'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'};\n{'e', 'd', 'c'}\n```The result is a set containing the strings `{'e', 'd', 'c'}`, which are present in both of the original sets."}, {"human": "What happens if there are duplicate elements in the sets?", "assistant": "If there are duplicate elements in the sets, they will appear in the result set as many times as they are present in both sets. The `intersect` operator essentially returns a set that contains all the unique elements that are common to both sets."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how transactions work in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, transactions are used to execute a series of EdgeQL commands atomically. That means either all the commands in the transaction are successfully executed, or none of them are, ensuring data integrity. However, you usually don't need to handle transactions manually because EdgeDB client libraries provide dedicated transaction APIs that manage this for you."}, {"human": "That sounds convenient. Can you show me an example of how a transaction might look in code?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have two `BankCustomer` objects, `'Customer1'` and `'Customer2'`, and you want to transfer 10 cents from the account of `'Customer1'` to `'Customer2'`. Here's a simplified example of what the transaction could look like using an EdgeDB client library:"}, {"human": "Okay, I'm following. Show me the code.", "assistant": "Assuming you're using a hypothetical EdgeDB client library, the code might look something like this:\n\n```python\nasync with edgedb.create_async_transaction() as transaction:\n    await transaction.execute('''\n        UPDATE BankCustomer\n        SET { balance := .balance - 0.10 }\n        FILTER .name = 'Customer1';\n\n        UPDATE BankCustomer\n        SET { balance := .balance + 0.10 }\n        FILTER .name = 'Customer2';\n    ''')\n```\n\nIn this example, the `create_async_transaction()` method creates a new transaction context. Inside this context, you execute your EdgeQL commands to update the balances of `'Customer1'` and `'Customer2'`. The transaction ensures that both updates are applied together."}, {"human": "What happens if there's an error during the transaction?", "assistant": "If an error occurs during the transaction, all changes made within the transaction are rolled back, and none of the commands are applied to the database. This rollback happens automatically, and the error is propagated back to your code so you can handle it appropriately."}, {"human": "Great, that makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or transactions, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use EdgeDB with TypeScript. Can you show me how to perform a transaction?", "assistant": "Sure! In TypeScript, you can perform a transaction using the EdgeDB client. Here's an example where we execute two `update` queries within a transaction to transfer funds between two bank customers:"}, {"human": "Okay, can you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's the TypeScript code snippet for performing the transaction:"}, {"human": "Great, let me see the code.", "assistant": "```typescript\nclient.transaction(async tx => {\n  await tx.execute(`update BankCustomer\n    filter .name = 'Customer1'\n    set { bank_balance := .bank_balance - 10 }`);\n  await tx.execute(`update BankCustomer\n    filter .name = 'Customer2'\n    set { bank_balance := .bank_balance + 10 }`);\n});\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so this code will deduct 10 from Customer1's balance and add 10 to Customer2's balance?", "assistant": "Exactly! The transaction ensures that both operations are executed as a single atomic action. If any part of the transaction fails, none of the changes will be applied to the database."}, {"human": "What happens if there's an error during the transaction?", "assistant": "If an error occurs during the transaction, all changes made within the transaction are rolled back. This means that the database will remain in the state it was before the transaction started, ensuring data consistency."}, {"human": "Got it. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about using EdgeDB with TypeScript or anything else, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how transactions work in EdgeDB with Python. Can you help me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, transactions are used to execute a series of database operations atomically. That means either all operations within the transaction are successfully completed, or none of them are applied if an error occurs. Would you like to see an example of how to use transactions in Python?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's a basic example of how you can use transactions in EdgeDB with Python. This code snippet demonstrates updating the bank balances of two customers atomically:\n```python\nasync for tx in client.transaction():\n    async with tx:\n        await tx.execute(\"\"\"update BankCustomer\n        filter .name = 'Customer1'\n        set { bank_balance := .bank_balance - 10 };\"\"\")\n        await tx.execute(\"\"\"update BankCustomer\n        filter .name = 'Customer2'\n        set { bank_balance := .bank_balance + 10 };\"\"\")\n```\nIn this example, we're deducting 10 units from Customer1's bank balance and adding the same amount to Customer2's bank balance. The operations are wrapped in a transaction to ensure that both updates succeed or fail together."}, {"human": "What happens if there's an error during the transaction?", "assistant": "If an error occurs during the execution of one of the operations within the transaction, the transaction will be rolled back. This means that none of the operations that were supposed to be executed in that transaction will be applied to the database. It's an all-or-nothing approach that helps maintain data integrity."}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I start and end a transaction?", "assistant": "In the example provided, the transaction is started with the `async for tx in client.transaction():` line. This creates a transaction object. The `async with tx:` line then enters the context of the transaction, allowing you to execute queries within it. When the block of code within the `async with` statement is completed, the transaction is automatically committed if no errors occurred, or rolled back if there were errors."}, {"human": "Is there a way to manually roll back a transaction?", "assistant": "Yes, you can manually roll back a transaction by calling the `rollback()` method on the transaction object. For example:\n```python\nasync for tx in client.transaction():\n    async with tx:\n        try:\n            # Execute some database operations...\n        except Exception as e:\n            # If an error occurs, roll back the transaction\n            await tx.rollback()\n            raise e\n```\nIn this snippet, if an exception is caught within the transaction block, we manually roll back the transaction before re-raising the exception."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how transactions work in EdgeDB with Golang. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, a transaction is a sequence of database operations that are executed as a single unit. In Golang, you can use the `Tx` method provided by the EdgeDB client to execute a transaction. Would you like to see an example of how to use it?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's a simple example of how you can use the `Tx` method to execute a couple of queries within a transaction in Golang:\n```go\nerr = client.Tx(ctx, func(ctx context.Context, tx *edgedb.Tx) error {\n    query1 := `update BankCustomer filter .name = 'Customer1' set { bank_balance := .bank_balance - 10 };`\n    if e := tx.Execute(ctx, query1); e != nil {\n        return e\n    }\n    query2 := `update BankCustomer filter .name = 'Customer2' set { bank_balance := .bank_balance + 10 };`\n    if e := tx.Execute(ctx, query2); e != nil {\n        return e\n    }\n    return nil\n})\nif err != nil {\n    // handle error\n}\n```\nThis code snippet starts a transaction and executes two queries. The first query deducts 10 from the bank balance of 'Customer1', and the second query adds 10 to the bank balance of 'Customer2'. If any of the queries fail, the transaction will be rolled back and the error will be returned."}, {"human": "What happens if there's an error in one of the queries?", "assistant": "If an error occurs in any of the queries within the transaction, the `Tx` function will return that error, and the transaction will be automatically rolled back. This means that none of the operations in the transaction will be applied to the database, ensuring atomicity. In the example, if either `query1` or `query2` fails, the error will be captured and returned, and the transaction will not commit any changes."}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I handle the error after the transaction?", "assistant": "After the transaction block, you should check if the `err` variable is not nil, which indicates that an error occurred during the transaction. You can then handle the error accordingly. Here's how you might do that:\n```go\nif err != nil {\n    // handle error\n    fmt.Println(\"Transaction failed:\", err)\n} else {\n    fmt.Println(\"Transaction succeeded\")\n}\n```\nIn this snippet, if `err` is not nil, it prints an error message indicating the transaction failed. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating the transaction succeeded."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use EdgeDB with Rust. Can you show me an example of how to update a record?", "assistant": "Sure! In Rust, you can use the EdgeDB client to execute an update query. Here's an example of how you might update a `BankCustomer`'s balance:"}, {"human": "Okay, I see. But what does the `$0` and `$1` mean in the query?", "assistant": "In the query, `$0` and `$1` are placeholders for parameters that you'll pass to the query. `$0` will be replaced by the first parameter, which in this case is the name of the customer, and `$1` will be replaced by the second parameter, which is the amount by which you want to change the balance."}, {"human": "Got it.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand type casting in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! Type casting in EdgeDB is used to convert primitive values into another type. You indicate a cast using angle brackets with a type expression inside. Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some examples.", "assistant": "Sure, here are a few examples of type casting in EdgeDB. If you want to cast an integer to a string, you can do it like this:\n```edgeql\nselect <str>10;\n```\nThis will output the string '10'."}, {"human": "What if I have a list of integers and I want to convert them all to strings?", "assistant": "You can cast each element of a list to a string like this:\n```edgeql\nselect <array<str>>[1, 2, 3];\n```\nThis will give you an array of strings: ['1', '2', '3']."}, {"human": "Can I cast elements inside a tuple as well?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can cast individual elements within a tuple. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect <tuple<str, int64, bigint>>(1, 2, 3);\n```\nThis will result in a tuple where the first element is cast to a string, and the third element is cast to a bigint, resulting in: ('1', 2, 3n)."}, {"human": "This is helpful, thanks! And what does 'n' stand for in '3n'?", "assistant": "The 'n' after a number indicates that the number is of type 'bigint' in EdgeDB. It's a way to specify the literal for a bigint type explicitly."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about type intersections in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, all elements of a given set have the same type. However, when we're dealing with sets of objects, the type might be abstract and contain elements of multiple concrete subtypes. For example, if you have an abstract type called `Media`, it might have subtypes like `Movie` and `TVShow`. A set of `Media` objects could contain objects that are either `Movie` or `TVShow` instances."}, {"human": "So, how would I select all `Media` objects in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "To select all `Media` objects, you would use the `SELECT` statement in EdgeQL. Here's an example of how you might do it in the EdgeDB REPL:\n```edgeql\nSELECT Media;\n```\nThis query would return a set of `Media` objects, which could include both `Movie` and `TVShow` objects if those are the subtypes of `Media`."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of what the result might look like?", "assistant": "Sure! When you run the `SELECT Media;` query, the result might look something like this:\n```edgeql\n{\n  default::Movie {id: '9d2ce01...'},\n  default::TVShow {id: '7b3be23...'},\n  ...\n}\n```\nThis result set is showing that there are `Movie` and `TVShow` objects in the `Media` set, each with their own unique IDs."}, {"human": "Got it. And if I wanted to only select `Movie` objects from the `Media` set?", "assistant": "If you want to select only `Movie` objects from the `Media` set, you can use a filter in your query. Here's how you could do it:\n```edgeql\nSELECT Media[IS Movie];\n```\nThis query uses the `IS` operator to filter the set of `Media` objects to only include those that are instances of the `Movie` subtype."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or EdgeQL, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about the type checking in EdgeDB. Can you explain how it works?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can check if a value is of a specific type using the `is` operator. It's used to determine if a given expression matches a specified type. Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some examples.", "assistant": "Alright, here's a simple example where we check if the number 5 is of type `int64`:\n```edgeql\nselect 5 is int64;  # Output: {true}\n```\nThis query will return `true` because 5 is indeed an integer of type `int64`."}, {"human": "What if I want to check for a type that doesn't match?", "assistant": "You can use the `is not` operator for that. For instance, if you want to check whether the numbers 3.14 and 2.718 are not of type `int64`, you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect {3.14, 2.718} is not int64;  # Output: {true, true}\n```\nThis query returns `true` for each number, indicating that neither is an `int64`."}, {"human": "Can it be used to check types of objects, like if a media item is a movie?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use the `is` operator to check if objects are of a certain type. For example, if you have a set of `Media` objects and you want to check which ones are `Movie` objects, you could use:\n```edgeql\nselect Media is Movie;  # Output might be: {true, true, false}\n```\nThe output is a set of boolean values indicating for each `Media` object whether it is a `Movie` object."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the clarification!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what the 'typeof' operator does in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'typeof' operator in EdgeDB is used to extract the type of any expression. You can use it in any context where a type is expected. For example, if you want to know the type of a string or a number, you can use 'typeof' to find out."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use 'typeof' in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a string '100' and you want to find out its type. You can use the following EdgeQL query: ```edgeql-repl db> select typeof '100'; {std::str} ``` This query will return the type of the string '100', which is 'std::str'."}, {"human": "What if I want to check if two values are of the same type?", "assistant": "You can use the 'is' operator along with 'typeof' to check if two values are of the same type. Here's an example: ```edgeql-repl db> select 'tuna' is typeof 'trout'; {true} ``` This query checks if the string 'tuna' is of the same type as 'trout', and since both are strings, it returns true."}, {"human": "That's pretty clear now. Thanks! Is there a place where I can learn more about this?", "assistant": "You're welcome! To learn more about the 'typeof' operator and other EdgeDB features, you can check out the official EdgeDB documentation. It has a wealth of information and examples to help you get a deeper understanding of how to use EdgeDB."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to update the name of a hero in my database. How do I do that with EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Sure, you can use the `update` command in EdgeQL. For example, if you want to update a hero named 'Hawkeye' to 'Ronin', you would use the following command: ```edgeql update Hero filter .name = 'Hawkeye' set { name := 'Ronin' }; ```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. And what happens if I don't use the `filter` clause?", "assistant": "If you omit the `filter` clause, the update command will apply to all objects of the type you're updating. So, be careful with that, as you might update more objects than intended."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me an example of updating all objects?", "assistant": "Certainly! If you want to update a property for all objects of a certain type, you would write the command without a filter. For example, if you want to set a 'retired' flag to true for all heroes, you could use: ```edgeql update Hero set { retired := true }; ``` Remember, this will update the 'retired' property for every Hero object in your database."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to update a record in EdgeDB but I'm not sure how to unset a property that's not required. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, if you want to unset a non-required property, you can set it to an empty set. Here's an example using EdgeQL:"}, {"human": "Could you show me the code snippet for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you would unset the 'middle_name' property for a person with a specific ID:"}, {"human": "Great, let me see the example.", "assistant": "```edgeql\nupdate Person filter .id = $id set { middle_name := {} };\n```"}, {"human": "That looks simple enough. What if I want to learn more about updating properties?", "assistant": "You can learn more about updating properties and other EdgeQL commands in the EdgeDB documentation. It provides comprehensive guides and examples to help you understand how to use EdgeQL effectively."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to update the characters linked to a movie in my EdgeDB database. Can you show me how to do that?", "assistant": "Certainly! To update links in EdgeDB, you can use the `:=` operator, which will replace the current set of linked values with the new ones you specify. Here's an example of how you can update the characters linked to the movie titled 'Black Widow':"}, {"human": "Okay, can you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the EdgeQL command you would use in the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):"}, {"human": "Alright, let me see the command.", "assistant": "```edgeql\nupdate Movie\nfilter .title = 'Black Widow'\nset {\n  characters := (\n    select Person\n    filter .name in {'Black Widow', 'Yelena', 'Dreykov'}\n  )\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What does this command do exactly?", "assistant": "This command updates the 'characters' link of the 'Movie' type where the title is 'Black Widow'. It sets the 'characters' link to a new set of 'Person' instances that have names 'Black Widow', 'Yelena', or 'Dreykov'. The `:=` operator replaces any existing characters linked to the movie with these new ones."}, {"human": "And what if I only wanted to add new characters without removing the existing ones?", "assistant": "If you want to add new characters without removing the existing ones, you would use the `+=` operator instead of `:=`. Here's how you can modify the command to add characters:"}, {"human": "Please show me the modified command.", "assistant": "```edgeql\nupdate Movie\nfilter .title = 'Black Widow'\nset {\n  characters += (\n    select Person\n    filter .name in {'Black Widow', 'Yelena', 'Dreykov'}\n  )\n};\n```"}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about the 'with' block in EdgeQL. Can you explain what it's for?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'with' block in EdgeQL is used to declare standalone expressions that you can then use within your query. It's a way to create temporary variables or aliases that make your queries more readable and can help you avoid repeating complex expressions."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's a simple example where we use the 'with' block to declare a string and then use it in a select statement:\n```edgeql\nwith my_str := 'hello world'\nselect str_title(my_str);\n```\nIn this example, `my_str` is the declared expression, and `str_title(my_str)` is a function call that capitalizes the first letter of each word in `my_str`. The result of the select statement would be {'Hello World'}."}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So, can I declare multiple expressions in a 'with' block?", "assistant": "Yes, you can declare multiple expressions in a 'with' block. Each declaration is separated by a comma. Here's how you could do it:\n```edgeql\nwith\n    my_str := 'hello world',\n    my_length := len(my_str)\nselect {\n    title: str_title(my_str),\n    length: my_length\n};\n```\nIn this query, we're declaring two expressions: `my_str` and `my_length`. We then use these expressions in the select statement to return the capitalized title and the length of the string."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! And can I use 'with' with other types of statements, like insert or update?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use the 'with' block with other top-level EdgeQL statements such as `insert`, `update`, and `delete`. It works in the same way by allowing you to define expressions that you can use in your statement. For example, if you wanted to insert a new item with a predefined name, you could do something like this:\n```edgeql\nwith\n    item_name := 'New Item'\ninsert Item {\n    name := item_name\n};\n```\nThis would insert a new `Item` with the name 'New Item'."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how subqueries work in EdgeDB. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeQL, which is the query language for EdgeDB, you can write very complex expressions because it's fully composable. This means you can embed queries within other queries, also known as subqueries. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of a subquery.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say we want to find all movies that feature at least one of the original six Avengers. We can write a query that first selects the heroes we're interested in and then uses that selection to filter the movies. Here's how it looks:"}, {"human": "Okay, I'm following. Can you show me the actual EdgeQL code for that?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's the EdgeQL code for the query we discussed:\n```\nwith avengers := (select Hero filter .name in {'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Captain America', 'Black Widow', 'Hawkeye'})\nselect Movie filter .actors in avengers\n```\nIn this query, we first define a 'with' block where we create a subquery to select heroes whose names are in the given set. Then, we select movies where the actors link includes any of the heroes we found in the subquery."}, {"human": "That makes sense. So the 'with' block is where the subquery goes?", "assistant": "Exactly! The 'with' block is used to introduce subqueries or aliases that you can then use in the main query. It helps to keep the query organized and readable, especially when dealing with complex logic."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the explanation! I'll try writing some subqueries on my own now.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance as you explore EdgeDB and EdgeQL, feel free to reach out. Happy querying!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use query parameters in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! Query parameters in EdgeDB are used to pass external values into an EdgeQL query. You can initialize these parameters using a `with` clause at the beginning of your query. Here's a simple example:"}, {"human": "Could you show me the example?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you can use a `with` clause to initialize a query parameter named `user_id` and then use it in a `select` statement to filter users by their ID:\n```edgeql\nwith user_id := $user_id\nselect User {\n  name\n}\nfilter .id = user_id;\n```"}, {"human": "I see. So the `$user_id` is the parameter that I pass into the query from outside?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `$user_id` is the placeholder for the actual value you'll provide when you execute the query. The `with` clause assigns this value to the `user_id` variable, which you can then use in the rest of your query."}, {"human": "Got it. And where can I find more information about using parameters in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "You can find a full reference on using query parameters in the EdgeQL section of the EdgeDB documentation, specifically under 'Parameters'. It will give you more details and examples on how to effectively use parameters in your queries."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how modules work in EdgeDB. Can you explain what an 'active module' is?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a module is a namespace that groups related schema objects, like types and functions. By default, the active module is `default`, which means you can reference any schema object within this module by its short name, such as `User` or `BlogPost`. If you want to reference objects in other modules, you need to use their fully-qualified names, like `default::Hero`."}, {"human": "So, if I have a type called `User` in the default module, how would I reference it in a query?", "assistant": "If `User` is in the default module, you can simply reference it by its short name in your query. For example, you could write a query like this to select all users:\n```\nSELECT User;\n```"}, {"human": "And what if I have a type with the same name in a different module?", "assistant": "If you have a type with the same name in a different module, you'll need to use the fully-qualified name to avoid ambiguity. For example, if you have a `User` type in a module named `auth`, you would reference it like this:\n```\nSELECT auth::User;\n```"}, {"human": "Is there a way to change the active module so I don't have to use the fully-qualified name all the time?", "assistant": "Yes, you can change the active module using a `with` clause. This allows you to set a different module as active for the scope of a query. For example:\n```\nWITH MODULE auth\nSELECT User;\n```\nIn this query, `User` would refer to `auth::User` because we've set `auth` as the active module with the `with` clause."}, {"human": "That's handy! Does this mean I can use multiple modules in a single query?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can reference objects from multiple modules in a single query by using their fully-qualified names. If you want to temporarily set a different module as active, you can use the `with` clause for that part of the query. Just remember that the `with` clause only changes the active module for the scope of the query it's used in."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use aliases in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, an alias is a way to create a new view of existing data. It's like a virtual type that you can define to present data in a different shape or form. For example, you can merge information from linked objects into a single flat structure. Would you like to see a simple example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say you have a type `Review` that has links to an `author` and a `movie`. You want to create an alias that includes the author's name and the movie's title along with the existing properties of `Review`. Here's how you could define such an alias in SDL:\n```sdl\nalias ReviewAlias := Review {\n    # It will already have all the Review properties and links.\n    author_name := .author.name,\n    movie_title := .movie.title,\n}\n```This alias `ReviewAlias` will now include two additional computed properties: `author_name` and `movie_title`, which are derived from the linked `author` and `movie` respectively."}, {"human": "I see. So, the properties `author_name` and `movie_title` are computed from the existing links. Do I need to do anything special to use this alias in a query?", "assistant": "No, you don't need to do anything special. Once you've defined the alias in your schema, you can use it in your EdgeQL queries just like you would with any other type. For example, you could select reviews with the author's name and movie's title like this:\n```edgeql\nSELECT ReviewAlias {\n    body,\n    rating,\n    author_name,\n    movie_title\n}\n```This query will return the body and rating from the `Review` type, along with the computed `author_name` and `movie_title` from the `ReviewAlias`."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I want to filter the results based on the computed properties?", "assistant": "You can filter on computed properties just like you would on regular properties. Here's an example of a query that filters reviews based on the `movie_title` computed property:\n```edgeql\nSELECT ReviewAlias {\n    body,\n    rating,\n    author_name,\n    movie_title\n}\nFILTER .movie_title = 'The Matrix'\n```This query will return only the reviews where the `movie_title` is 'The Matrix'."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! Can I also order the results by these computed properties?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can use the `ORDER BY` clause with computed properties to sort your results. For instance:\n```edgeql\nSELECT ReviewAlias {\n    body,\n    rating,\n    author_name,\n    movie_title\n}\nORDER BY .movie_title ASC\n```This will return the reviews sorted in ascending order by the `movie_title`. You can also use `DESC` to sort in descending order."}, {"human": "This makes a lot of sense now. Thanks for the clear explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to add some descriptions to my database schema in EdgeDB. Can you show me how to do that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use annotations to add descriptions to types, properties, and links. Here's an example using the Schema Definition Language (SDL):"}, {"human": "Great, can you provide me with a sample SDL?", "assistant": "Sure, here's a sample SDL snippet that adds descriptions to a type and a link within that type:\n```\nsdl\ntype Label {\n    annotation description := 'Special label to stick on reviews';\n    required comments: str;\n    review -> Review {\n        annotation description := 'This review needs some attention';\n    };\n}\n\ntype Review {\n    content: str;\n    ...\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so I just need to use the 'annotation' keyword followed by 'description' and then ':=' to assign the description?", "assistant": "Exactly! You use the 'annotation' keyword followed by 'description' and then ':=' to assign a string that describes the type, property, or link. This description can then be used for documentation purposes or by tools that introspect the schema."}, {"human": "And this description is just a string, right? Can it be of any length?", "assistant": "Yes, the description is a string, and it can be of any length that suits your needs. Just make sure it's enclosed in single quotes if it's a literal string."}, {"human": "Got it. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm having some trouble understanding boolean expressions in EdgeDB. Can you help me out?", "assistant": "Of course! Boolean expressions can indeed be a bit tricky. What specifically are you having trouble with?"}, {"human": "I'm confused about how empty sets are treated with 'and' and 'or' compared to 'all()' and 'any()'.", "assistant": "Ah, I see. In EdgeDB, the 'and' and 'or' operators require both operands to produce a result. This means that if one of the operands is an empty set `{}`, the expression won't produce a result. On the other hand, 'all()' and 'any()' functions handle empty sets differently."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how 'and' and 'or' work with empty sets?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a boolean expression like this: `SELECT User FILTER User.active AND {};`. Since the second operand is an empty set, the whole expression will not produce a result, effectively filtering out all records, even if some `User` entries have `active` set to `true`."}, {"human": "And how does it work with 'all()' and 'any()'? Are they different?", "assistant": "Yes, they are different. For example, if you use `all()` like this: `SELECT User FILTER all(User.groups);`, it will return `true` for users with no groups (since it's not the case that any group is false), and `false` for users with one or more groups that evaluate to `false`. Conversely, `any()` will return `false` for users with no groups, and `true` if at least one group evaluates to `true`."}, {"human": "I see, so 'all()' and 'any()' are more permissive with empty sets.", "assistant": "Exactly! They are designed to handle empty sets in a way that's often more intuitive when dealing with collections that might be empty. Remember that 'all()' will return `true` for an empty set, while 'any()' will return `false` for an empty set."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or boolean expressions, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I need to remove all reviews made by a user named 'trouble2020'. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can delete all reviews from a specific user with the following EdgeQL query: ```edgeql delete Review filter .author.name = 'trouble2020' ``` This will remove all Review entries where the author's name is 'trouble2020'."}, {"human": "Is there another way to do this? Just in case I need an alternative method.", "assistant": "Certainly! There's an alternative way to delete all reviews from a specific user: ```edgeql delete ( select User filter .name = 'troll2020' ).<author[is Review] ``` This query selects the User with the name 'troll2020' and then deletes all Review entries linked to that user as the author."}, {"human": "Oops, I think there's a typo in the second query. The username should be 'trouble2020', right?", "assistant": "My apologies for the oversight. Yes, you're correct. Here's the corrected query: ```edgeql delete ( select User filter .name = 'trouble2020' ).<author[is Review] ``` This will delete all Review entries where 'trouble2020' is the author."}, {"human": "Great, thanks! And just to confirm, this will only delete the reviews, not the user itself, right?", "assistant": "That's correct. Both of these queries will only delete the Review entries. The User entry for 'trouble2020' will remain intact in the database."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to declare a function in EdgeDB that counts reviews by a user's name. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can declare a function using the `create function` statement. Here's how you can define a function named `review_count` that takes a user's name as a parameter and returns the count of reviews written by that user:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the EdgeQL code for the function you want to create:\n```edgeql\ncreate function review_count(name: str) -> int64 using (\n    with module default\n    select count(\n        (select Review filter .author.name = name)\n    )\n)\n```"}, {"human": "That looks good. But what if I need to remove this function later on?", "assistant": "If you need to drop a user-defined function, you can use the `drop function` statement followed by the function name. For example, to drop the `review_count` function, you would write:\n```edgeql\ndrop function review_count\n```"}, {"human": "Is that all I need to do to drop it?", "assistant": "Yes, that's correct. Just make sure that you specify the correct function name and that you have the necessary permissions to drop functions in the database."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to insert some data into my EdgeDB database. Can you show me how to insert a basic movie record?", "assistant": "Of course! To insert a basic movie stub into your EdgeDB database, you can use the following EdgeQL command:"}, {"human": "Great, can you provide me with the EdgeQL command?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's the EdgeQL command to insert a movie titled 'Dune' from the year 2020 with an image filename 'dune2020.jpg'. It also links to a director by filtering for a person with the full name 'Denis Villeneuve':\n```edgeql\ninsert Movie {\n    title := 'Dune',\n    year := 2020,\n    image := 'dune2020.jpg',\n    directors := (\n        select Person\n        filter .full_name = 'Denis Villeneuve'\n    )\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That looks straightforward. But what if I have the movie data in JSON format? Can I insert it that way?", "assistant": "Yes, you can insert data using JSON as well. The documentation mentions an alternative way to insert a movie using JSON, but it doesn't provide the exact command. Would you like me to show you an example of how to insert JSON data?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "To insert a movie using JSON, you would typically use a client library in a programming language that supports JSON input. The EdgeQL command itself doesn't directly take JSON, but you can construct the command using JSON data in your client code. Here's a hypothetical example in Python using a client library:\n```python\nimport edgedb\n\n# Assuming 'client' is an instance of an EdgeDB client\n\njson_data = {\n    'title': 'Dune',\n    'year': 2020,\n    'image': 'dune2020.jpg',\n    'director_full_name': 'Denis Villeneuve'\n}\n\nquery = '''\n    INSERT Movie {\n        title := <str>$title,\n        year := <int16>$year,\n        image := <str>$image,\n        directors := (\n            SELECT Person\n            FILTER .full_name = <str>$director_full_name\n        )\n    }\n'''\n\nclient.query(query, json_data)\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so I need to use a client library to handle the JSON.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to add a new review and a new user to our database at the same time. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! You can use EdgeDB's insert command to create new records. To insert a new review and a new user in one step, you would typically use a nested insert. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you can create a new review for the movie 'Dune' and a new user in one step using EdgeQL: \n```edgedb\ninsert Review {\n  body := 'Dune is cool',\n  rating := 5,\n  # Assuming the movie record already exists, so select it.\n  movie := (\n    select Movie\n    filter .title = 'Dune' and .year = 2020\n    # The limit is needed to satisfy the single link requirement.\n    limit 1\n  ),\n  # Insert a new user at the same time.\n  author := (\n    insert User {\n      name := 'New User'\n    }\n  )\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What if the movie 'Dune' doesn't exist in the database?", "assistant": "If the movie 'Dune' doesn't exist, you would need to insert it as well.

But what does 'unless conflict on' mean?", "assistant": "'unless conflict on' is a clause in EdgeDB that allows you to handle potential conflicts that may arise if a record with the same unique constraints already exists in the database. In this case, it checks if a movie with the same title and year already exists. If it does, the 'else' block is executed, selecting the existing movie. If not, a new movie record is created. This prevents duplicate entries and ensures data integrity."}, {"human": "Got it! And what does the 'limit 1' do in the select statement?", "assistant": "The 'limit 1' clause is used to ensure that the query returns at most one record. This is important when you are assigning the result to a link that expects a single object, like the 'movie' link in the 'Review' type. If the query without 'limit 1' returns more than one record, it would result in an error because the link is supposed to hold only a single 'Movie' record, not multiple ones."}, {"human": "Makes sense.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use 'unless conflict' in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the 'unless conflict' clause is used to perform an 'upsert' operation. This means that the database will try to insert a new record, but if a conflict occurs, such as a unique constraint violation, it will do nothing or update the conflicting record instead of throwing an error. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example with a User entity.", "assistant": "Sure, here's an example where we try to insert a new User with the name 'Alice' and an image. If a User with the name 'Alice' already exists, we do nothing.

And what happens if there are multiple conflicts?", "assistant": "The 'unless conflict' clause can only handle one conflict target at a time. If you have multiple unique constraints that could be violated, you would need to handle them separately. You can specify the conflict target by using a property or a constraint expression.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to create a social network database with EdgeDB and I want to represent friendships between people. How can I do that?", "assistant": "Hello! In EdgeDB, you can represent friendships using a link. For example, you can create a `Person` type and add a `friends` link to it. You can also include a property to this link to represent the strength of the friendship. Here's how you can define it in SDL:"}, {"human": "Okay, can you show me an example of how that would look?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's an SDL snippet that defines a `Person` type with a `friends` link. The `friends` link is a multi link because a person can have multiple friends. Additionally, there's a `strength` property on the `friends` link to represent the strength of each friendship as a float64 number.\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  required name: str { constraint exclusive };\n  multi friends: Person {\n    strength: float64;\n  }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Great, thanks! And what does the 'constraint exclusive' mean for the name property?", "assistant": "The `constraint exclusive` on the `name` property ensures that each `Person` has a unique name within the database. No two `Person` objects can have the same name, which helps in maintaining the uniqueness of individuals in your social network."}, {"human": "I see. And if I wanted to add more properties to the Person type, how would I do that?", "assistant": "To add more properties to the `Person` type, you simply define them within the type block. For example, if you wanted to add an `age` property and an `email` property, you would update the `Person` type like this:\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  required name: str { constraint exclusive };\n  age: int16;\n  email: str { constraint exclusive };\n  multi friends: Person {\n    strength: float64;\n  }\n}\n```Here, `age` is an optional property of type `int16`, and `email` is a required property with a uniqueness constraint, similar to `name`."}, {"human": "That makes sense. And how do I actually create these objects in the database?", "assistant": "To create objects in the database, you would use EdgeQL, which is EdgeDB's query language. For instance, to create a new `Person` with a name, age, and email, you would write an EdgeQL command like this:\n```edgedb\nINSERT Person {\n  name := 'Alice',\n  age := 30,\n  email := 'alice@example.com'\n};\n```To establish a friendship between two people, you would use the `UPDATE` command to modify the `friends` link of a `Person` object."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to establish a friendship?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you have two `Person` objects, one named 'Alice' and another named 'Bob', and you want to make them friends with a certain strength of friendship. You would use the `UPDATE` command like this:\n```edgedb\nUPDATE Person\nSET {\n  friends += (\n    SELECT Person\n    FILTER .name = 'Bob'\n  ) {@strength := 0.75}\n}\nFILTER .name = 'Alice';\n```This command finds the `Person` named 'Alice' and adds 'Bob' to her `friends` link with a `strength` of 0.75."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how constraints work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me with an example?", "assistant": "Of course!

No two `Person` objects can have the same name.\n\nThe `expression` constraint on the `friends` link with the `strength` property ensures that the `strength` value is always greater than or equal to 0. This means you can't have a negative strength value for any friendship."}, {"human": "I see. And what does `__subject__` refer to in the expression constraint?", "assistant": "`__subject__` is a placeholder that refers to the current object being evaluated by the constraint. In this case, it refers to an instance of a `Person`'s `friends` link. So `__subject__->strength` is accessing the `strength` property of the `friends` link of the `Person`."}, {"human": "Got it! And how would I enforce that the strength must be less than or equal to 100?", "assistant": "You would update the `expression` constraint like this:\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  multi friends: Person {\n    strength: float64;\n    constraint expression on (__subject__->strength >= 0 and __subject__->strength <= 100);\n  }\n}\n```\nThis ensures that the `strength` value is between 0 and 100, inclusive."}, {"human": "That makes sense.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to optimize my database queries in EdgeDB and I heard that indexes can help. Can you explain how to create an index on a link property?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, to create an index on a link property, you first need to declare an abstract link. Then, you extend this abstract link in the type where you want to use it. Here's an example of how you can create an index on a link property called 'strength' for a 'friends' link in a 'Person' type:"}, {"human": "Okay, I think I get it. But what does the abstract link do exactly?", "assistant": "An abstract link serves as a template that you can reuse across different types. It's not tied to any particular type until you extend it. In the context of indexing, it allows you to define properties and indexes for a link that can then be applied to actual links in your schema. Here's how you declare an abstract link with a property and an index:"}, {"human": "Could you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the SDL code snippet for declaring an abstract link with a property 'strength' and an index on that property. After that, it shows how to extend this abstract link in a 'Person' type:\n```sdl\nabstract link friendship {\n  strength: float64;\n  index on (__subject__->strength);\n}\n\ntype Person {\n  required name: str { constraint exclusive };\n  multi friends: Person {\n    extending friendship;\n  };\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so `__subject__` refers to the source of the link in the index definition?", "assistant": "Exactly! In the index definition, `__subject__` refers to the source of the link, which in this case is an instance of the 'Person' type. By using `__subject__->strength`, you're specifying that the index should be built on the 'strength' property of the 'friendship' link."}, {"human": "Got it. And can I use this abstract link for other types as well, not just 'Person'?", "assistant": "Yes, you can! That's the beauty of abstract links. You can extend them in any type where you need the same kind of link with its properties and indexes. This helps keep your schema DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and consistent."}, {"human": "This is really helpful, thanks! I'll try this out in my schema.", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use the '@' symbol in EdgeQL. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeQL, the '@' symbol is used to denote a link property. Link properties are additional pieces of information attached to a link between two objects. For example, if you have a 'Person' type with a 'friends' link, you might want to store the 'strength' of each friendship, which could be a floating-point number."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to insert a link property in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's an example where we insert a new 'Person' named Bob, and we also specify the strength of his friendship with Alice using a link property '@strength':\n```edgeql\ninsert Person {\n  name := \"Bob\",\n  friends := (\n    select detached Person {\n      @strength := 3.14\n    }\n    filter .name = \"Alice\"\n  )\n}\n```In this example, we're inserting a new person with a name 'Bob' and setting the 'friends' link to a person named 'Alice'. We use a subquery to select 'Alice' and set the '@strength' property of the friendship link to 3.14."}, {"human": "What does 'detached' mean in this context?", "assistant": "The keyword 'detached' is used to indicate that the query should be executed in a context that is separate from the current mutation context. In other words, it allows you to select 'Alice' without considering the current insertion operation. This is necessary because, without 'detached', the query would be looking for 'Alice' within the new data being inserted, which is not what we want. We want to link to the existing 'Alice' in the database."}, {"human": "Is there anything special I need to know when using '@' inside an insert statement?", "assistant": "Yes, there is something important to note. The '@' property, like '@strength' in our example, can only be specified within the shape of a 'select' subquery that is part of an 'insert' statement. This means you can't directly set a link property on the top-level insert; it has to be done through a subquery."}]}

Here's an example of how you can set the `@strength` property of Bob's friends link to Alice to 3.7:"}, {"human": "Okay, I see. But what does the '+=' operator do in this context?", "assistant": "In the context of multi links, the '+=' operator acts like an insert or update operator. When you use it with the `update` statement, it will either insert a new link if it doesn't exist or update the existing link. In your case, it will ensure that Bob's friends link to Alice has the `@strength` property set to 3.7."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me the exact EdgeQL code for this update?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's the EdgeQL code snippet that updates the `@strength` property of the friends link from Bob to Alice:"}, {"human": "Thanks! And how would I write this in SDL?", "assistant": "In SDL, you define the schema rather than perform updates. However, to represent a link with a property in SDL, you would define it like this:"}, {"human": "I see, but I'm still a bit confused about how to use the '+=' operator in the update statement.", "assistant": "No problem, let's clarify that with an example.

Link properties are additional pieces of data attached to a link between two objects."}, {"human": "Got it. And what's with the 'default::Person' in the result?", "assistant": "In the result, 'default::Person' indicates the schema and type of the object being returned. 'default' is the default module where your types are defined if you haven't specified another module, and 'Person' is the type of the object."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use abstract types in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, an abstract type is a type that cannot be instantiated on its own. It's used as a template for other types that extend from it. Abstract types are useful when you have a common set of properties or links that you want to share across multiple types."}, {"human": "I see. Can you show me an example of how to define an abstract type?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example of an abstract type called `HasImage` that includes a required property `image` which is a URL to an image, and an index on the `image` property for faster querying:\n```sdl\nabstract type HasImage {\n    required image: str;\n    index on (.image);\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I create a type that extends from this abstract type?", "assistant": "To create a type that extends from an abstract type, you simply define a new type and specify that it is extending the abstract type. Here's how you can define a `User` type that extends from the `HasImage` abstract type, including a required `name` property and a constraint to ensure that each `User` has a unique name:\n```sdl\ntype User extending HasImage {\n    required name: str;\n    # Ensure unique name for each User.\n    constraint exclusive;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. So the `User` type will have both the `name` and `image` properties?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `User` type will inherit the `image` property from the `HasImage` abstract type, and it will also have its own `name` property. This means instances of `User` will need to provide values for both `name` and `image` when they are created."}, {"human": "Can I add more properties or links to the `User` type later on?", "assistant": "Yes, you can always extend the `User` type by adding more properties or links to it. Just make sure to follow the SDL syntax for defining properties and links. Remember that if you add new required properties, you will need to provide values for them when creating new instances of the `User` type."}]}

What does that mean?", "assistant": "The ':=' operator is used to define a computed link or property. In this case, 'reviews' is a computed link that fetches the set of reviews related to the movie. The '.<movie[is Review]' part is a backlink expression that finds all Review objects where the 'movie' link points to the current movie we are selecting."}, {"human": "And what about the 'is' keyword in the backlink expression?", "assistant": "The 'is' keyword is used to filter by type. It ensures that only objects of type 'Review' are selected in the backlink expression. This is useful when the link could point to objects of multiple types and you want to restrict the results to a single type."}, {"human": "Got it!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to perform a set intersection in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can perform a set intersection by using the 'filter' clause.

So the variable 'numbers' holds the set before we sort it, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The variable 'numbers' holds the set {3, 1, 2}, and the 'order by' clause sorts the set in ascending order by default. If you need to sort in descending order, you can add 'DESC' after the variable in the 'order by' clause."}, {"human": "That's really helpful. Thanks for explaining!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

In EdgeDB, a free object is a transient data structure that you can use within a query to store intermediate results or to reshape the output. They are not stored in the database but are created on-the-fly during query execution. Free objects can be useful for organizing data in a way that's more convenient for the specific needs of your query."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use a free object in a query?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you want to create a free object with a set of numbers and then order them. Here's how you could do it in EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nwith numbers := {3, 1, 2} select numbers order by numbers;\n``` \nThis query creates a free object containing the numbers 3, 1, and 2, and then selects them in ascending order."}, {"human": "What's the advantage of using free objects?", "assistant": "The advantage of using free objects is that they allow for more efficient data processing within a query. Since they are transient and not stored in the database, they can be used to temporarily hold data that you need to manipulate or restructure without affecting the underlying database schema or data. This can lead to more performant and cleaner queries, especially when dealing with complex data transformations."}]}

For example, if you're inserting data into a database, you might write a query like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst insertQuery = e.insert(e.Movie, {\n  title: e.str('My Favorite Movie'),\n  release_year: e.int64(2021),\n  rating: e.float64(8.5),\n  has_digital_release: e.bool(true)\n});\n```\n\nThis will insert a new movie with the specified title, release year, rating, and digital release status. Each field uses the appropriate EdgeDB type literal to ensure the data types are correctly handled. Does that make sense?"}, {"human": "Got it, that's really helpful. What about querying data with these types?", "assistant": "When querying data, you can also use these type literals to filter results or match values. For example, if you want to find all movies with a rating higher than 7.5, you could write:\n\n```typescript\nconst selectQuery = e.select(e.Movie, movie => ({\n  title: true,\n  rating: true,\n  filter: e.op(movie.rating, '>', e.float64(7.5))\n}));\n```\n\nThis query selects the title and rating of movies where the rating is greater than 7.5. The `e.float64(7.5)` ensures that the comparison is done using the correct data type. Do you need examples for any other specific use cases?"}, {"human": "No, that's all for now.

In EdgeQL, you can use literals to represent fixed values. Here are a few examples for different types of literals:"}, {"human": "What about UUIDs? How do I write a UUID literal?", "assistant": "To write a UUID literal in EdgeQL, you simply use the UUID string within single quotes. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect 'a5ea6360-75bd-4c20-b69c-8f317b0d2857';\n```\nThis will return the UUID as a set containing the given UUID value."}, {"human": "I see. And how do I select a specific timestamp?", "assistant": "To select a timestamp, you write the timestamp in the ISO 8601 format within single quotes. Here's how you can select the timestamp for March 31st, 1999 at 3:17 PM UTC:\n```edgeql\nselect '1999-03-31T15:17:00Z';\n```\nThe result will be a set with the specified timestamp."}, {"human": "Got it. What if I want to select a duration, like a time interval?", "assistant": "For durations, you can use a format that specifies the hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, to select a duration of 5 hours, 4 minutes, and 3 seconds, you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect '5 hours 4 minutes 3 seconds';\n```\nThe result will be a set with the duration formatted as '5:04:03'."}, {"human": "And what about selecting a period longer than days, like years and days together?", "assistant": "For periods that include years and days, you can use the ISO 8601 duration format. Here's how you select a period of 2 years and 18 days:\n```edgeql\nselect '2 years 18 days';\n```\nThe result will be a set with the period formatted as 'P2Y18D'."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to use EdgeDB with TypeScript, but I'm not sure how to handle different data types. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! EdgeDB provides various functions to handle different data types in TypeScript. For example, if you want to create a UUID, you can use the `e.uuid()` function. Here's how you can use it:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me an example of how to use `e.uuid()`?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a TypeScript snippet that demonstrates how to use `e.uuid()` to create a UUID from a string:"}, {"human": "Okay, I'll try that. What about dates and times?", "assistant": "For dates and times, you can use the `e.datetime()` function. It takes a string representation of a date and time and converts it into a JavaScript `Date` object. Here's an example:"}, {"human": "That makes sense. And what if I need to work with durations?", "assistant": "EdgeDB has you covered there as well. For durations, you can use the `e.duration()` function to create an `edgedb.Duration` object, which is a custom class. Additionally, for relative durations, you can use `e.cal.relative_duration()` to create an `edgedb.RelativeDuration` object. Here's how you can use these functions:"}, {"human": "This is really helpful, thanks! Can I also create arrays and tuples with these types?", "assistant": "Yes, you can compose primitive data into arrays and tuples as needed. For example, you can create an array of UUIDs or an array of `edgedb.Duration` objects. The same applies to tuples. Just use the standard TypeScript syntax for arrays and tuples."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use tuples and arrays in EdgeQL. Can you show me some examples?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeQL, you can create arrays by enclosing a list of elements in square brackets. Here's an example of selecting an array with two elements, 'hello' and 'world':\n```edgeql\nselect ['hello', 'world'];\n```\nThis will output: `{['hello', 'world']}`."}, {"human": "Got it, that's for arrays. What about tuples?", "assistant": "Tuples can be created by enclosing elements in parentheses. There are two types of tuples: unnamed and named. Here's an example of an unnamed tuple:\n```edgeql\nselect ('Apple', 7, true);\n```\nThis will output: `{('Apple', 7, true)}`."}, {"human": "I see, and what's a named tuple then?", "assistant": "A named tuple is similar to an unnamed tuple, but each element has a name associated with it. Here's how you can create a named tuple:\n```edgeql\nselect (fruit := 'Apple', quantity := 3.14, fresh := true);\n```\nThis will output: `{(fruit := 'Apple', quantity := 3.14, fresh := true)}`. As you can see, each element in the tuple is given a name like `fruit`, `quantity`, and `fresh`."}, {"human": "What if I want to select an array with more elements?", "assistant": "You can include as many elements as you need in an array. Just separate them with commas within the square brackets. Here's an example with four elements:\n```edgeql\nselect ['this', 'is', 'an', 'array'];\n```\nThis will output an array with those four strings."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use EdgeDB with TypeScript. Can you show me some examples?", "assistant": "Certainly! EdgeDB provides a way to interact with data using TypeScript. For example, if you want to create an array of strings, you can use the `e.array` method like this:\n```typescript\ne.array(['hello', 'world']);\n// This will be of type string[]\n```"}, {"human": "What about tuples? How do I define them in TypeScript with EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Tuples can be defined using the `e.tuple` method. Here's how you can define a tuple with a string, a number, and a boolean:\n```typescript\ne.tuple(['Apple', 7, true]);\n// This will be of type [string, number, boolean]\n```"}, {"human": "Can I also define a tuple with named fields?", "assistant": "Yes, you can define a tuple with named fields using an object with the `e.tuple` method. Here's an example:\n```typescript\ne.tuple({fruit: 'Apple', quantity: 3.14, fresh: true});\n// This will be of type {fruit: string; quantity: number; fresh: boolean}\n```"}, {"human": "I see. And how do I work with JSON types in EdgeDB and TypeScript?", "assistant": "When working with JSON types, you can use the `e.json` method. Since JSON can be quite flexible, the type is set to `unknown` to allow for any valid JSON structure. Here's an example of using `e.json` with an array:\n```typescript\ne.json(['this', 'is', 'an', 'array']);\n// The type will be unknown\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use EdgeQL to select literals and convert them to JSON. Can you show me some examples?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeQL, you can select literals directly. For example, if you want to select the number 5, you can simply write:\n```edgeql\nedgedb> select 5;\n```\nThis will return:\n```json\n{\"5\"}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. What if I want to select an array of numbers?", "assistant": "Selecting an array is just as straightforward. You can select an array of numbers like this:\n```edgeql\nedgedb> select [1, 2, 3];\n```\nAnd you'll get the following result:\n```json\n{\"[1, 2, 3]\"}\n```"}, {"human": "I see. How about converting a string that represents a JSON array into actual JSON?", "assistant": "You can use the `to_json` function for that. Here's how you can convert a string representing a JSON array with an object inside it:\n```edgeql\nedgedb> select to_json('[{ \"name\": \"Peter Parker\" }]');\n```\nThe result will be a JSON array:\n```json\n{\"[{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Peter Parker\\\"}]\"}\n```"}, {"human": "That's cool! Can I also extract a specific field from the JSON result?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can extract a specific field from the JSON result by using the index and key. For example, to get the 'name' field from the first object in the JSON array, you would write:\n```edgeql\nedgedb> select to_json('[{ \"name\": \"Peter Parker\" }]')[0]['name'];\n```\nThis will give you the name directly:\n```json\n{\"\\\"Peter Parker\\\"\"}\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how EdgeDB handles JSON results in TypeScript. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In TypeScript, when you perform a query that returns JSON, the result is represented with the type `unknown`. This is because JSON can be anything \u2013 an object, an array, a string, a number, etc. \u2013 and TypeScript prefers to be explicit about types for safety."}, {"human": "So, if I have a query that returns JSON, how do I work with the result in TypeScript?", "assistant": "You would typically need to cast the result to a more specific type that you expect. For example, if you know that your query returns an array of objects with a `name` property, you would cast it like this:\n```typescript\nconst result = e.to_json('[{ \"name\": \"Peter Parker\" }]') as { name: string }[];\nconsole.log(result[0].name); // Now TypeScript knows this is a string\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. But what if I'm not sure what the JSON structure will be?", "assistant": "If you're not sure about the structure, you'll have to use type guards or type assertions to inform TypeScript about the structure at runtime. For instance, you can check if an object has a property 'name' before accessing it:\n```typescript\nconst result = e.to_json('[{ \"name\": \"Peter Parker\" }]');\nif (typeof result === 'object' && result !== null && 'name' in result) {\n  console.log(result['name']);\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What if I directly access a property on the JSON result without any checks?", "assistant": "If you try to directly access a property on a JSON result, TypeScript will warn you because the type is `unknown`. You need to use type assertions or checks to narrow down the type. Here's an example of what happens if you don't:\n```typescript\nconst name = e.to_json('[{ \"name\": \"Peter Parker\" }]')[0]['name'];\n// TypeScript will mark this as an error because the type is 'unknown'\n```"}, {"human": "I see. So using `unknown` forces me to be more careful with JSON results. Thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "Exactly! It's all about ensuring type safety. You're welcome, and if you have any more questions about EdgeDB or TypeScript, feel free to ask!"}]}

Here's an example of how you can delete movies with titles that start with 'The Avengers': ```edgeql delete Movie filter .title ilike 'The Avengers%' limit 3; ``` This command will delete up to 3 movies whose titles start with 'The Avengers', case-insensitively."}, {"human": "Great, but what does 'ilike' mean in this context?", "assistant": "'ilike' is an operator in EdgeQL that performs a case-insensitive comparison. It's similar to 'like', but it doesn't care about the case of the letters. So, '.title ilike 'The Avengers%'' will match titles like 'the avengers', 'The Avengers', or 'THE AVENGERS', followed by any characters."}, {"human": "And what's the purpose of the 'limit 3' part?", "assistant": "The 'limit 3' clause restricts the number of records that will be deleted to 3. Without it, all records matching the filter would be deleted. It's a way to limit the impact of the delete operation, which can be useful if you only want to remove a few records at a time or prevent accidental deletion of too many entries."}, {"human": "Got it! So if I want to delete all movies with that title, I just remove the 'limit' part?", "assistant": "Exactly! If you want to delete all movies that start with 'The Avengers', you would use the following command: ```edgeql delete Movie filter .title ilike 'The Avengers%'; ``` Just be careful when doing this, as it will remove all matching records from your database."}]}

For example:\n```typescript\n[{ id: 'movie_id_1' }, { id: 'movie_id_2' }, ...]\n```\nEach object in the array represents a movie that was deleted, identified by its `id`."}, {"human": "That's clear now.

Here's how you can select actors named 'Benedict Cumberbatch' and 'Benedict Wong':\n```typescript\nconst actors = e.select(e.Person, person => ({\n  filter: e.op(person.name, 'in', e.set(\n    'Benedict Cumberbatch',\n    'Benedict Wong'\n  ))\n}));\n```"}, {"human": "I see, that makes sense. And how would I add these actors to the cast of 'Doctor Strange'?", "assistant": "The documentation snippet you provided ends abruptly, but typically, to add actors to a movie's cast, you would update the movie record with a link to the actor records. However, without the complete documentation or context, I can't provide the exact code. You would generally use an `update` query in EdgeDB to achieve this."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to insert a new movie into my database using EdgeDB but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can insert new records using the EdgeQL INSERT statement. Here's an example of how you can insert a new movie:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me the code?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's the EdgeQL code snippet for inserting a new movie titled 'Avengers: The Kang Dynasty' with a release year of 2025:\n```edgeql\nwith new_movie := (insert Movie {\n  title := \"Avengers: The Kang Dynasty\",\n  release_year := 2025\n})\nselect new_movie {\n  title,\n  release_year\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What does the 'with' keyword do here?", "assistant": "The 'with' keyword in EdgeQL is used to create a common table expression (CTE). In this case, `new_movie` is a CTE that holds the result of the INSERT operation. After inserting the new movie, we use a SELECT statement to retrieve the title and release year of the newly inserted movie."}, {"human": "I see. And what if I want to insert multiple movies at once?", "assistant": "To insert multiple movies, you can use the same INSERT statement but include multiple sets of curly braces, each containing the properties of a different movie. Here's an example:\n```edgeql\ninsert Movie {\n  title := \"Avengers: The Kang Dynasty\",\n  release_year := 2025\n},\n{\n  title := \"Another Movie Title\",\n  release_year := 2023\n};\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I know if the insert was successful?", "assistant": "If the insert operation is successful, the SELECT statement that follows will return the details of the inserted movie. If there's an error, EdgeDB will raise an exception with details about what went wrong. Make sure your database schema supports the fields you are trying to insert."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand polymorphic queries in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, polymorphic queries allow you to select data from an abstract type and fetch all objects that extend it. This means you can write a single query to retrieve different types of related data. Would you like to see an example based on a schema?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Alright, let's consider a schema with an abstract type `Content` and two types `Movie` and `TVShow` that extend `Content`. Here's how the schema looks:\n```sdl\nabstract type Content {\n  required title: str;\n}\n\ntype Movie extending Content {\n  release_year: int64;\n}\n\ntype TVShow extending Content {\n  num_seasons: int64;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Okay, I see the schema. How would I fetch all content with a single query?", "assistant": "To fetch all content, you can use a `select` statement on the abstract type `Content`. Here's an example query:\n```edgeql\nSELECT Content {\n  title,\n  [is Movie].release_year,\n  [is TVShow].num_seasons\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What does the `[is Movie]` syntax mean?", "assistant": "The `[is Movie]` syntax is used to filter only the instances of `Content` that are actually `Movie` objects. It allows you to access properties specific to the `Movie` type, like `release_year`, within the same query. Similarly, `[is TVShow]` filters for `TVShow` objects and allows access to `num_seasons`. If the instance is not of the specified type, the property will be `null` in the result set."}, {"human": "Got it. Can I also filter the results to get only movies or only TV shows?", "assistant": "Absolutely! If you want to select only movies or only TV shows, you can use a filter with the `is` keyword. For example, to get only movies, you can write:\n```edgeql\nSELECT Content FILTER Content[is Movie] {\n  title,\n  [is Movie].release_year\n};\n```"}, {"human": "That's really helpful. Thanks for explaining polymorphic queries to me!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand this EdgeQL query I found in the documentation. Can you explain what it does?", "assistant": "Of course! The EdgeQL query you're looking at is designed to select data from an entity called 'Content'. It retrieves the 'title' of the content, and then it uses a type filter to retrieve 'num_seasons' only if the content is a TV show, and 'release_year' only if the content is a movie. Would you like to see a more detailed breakdown?"}, {"human": "Yes, please. What does the [is TVShow] and [is Movie] syntax mean?", "assistant": "The syntax `[is TVShow]` and `[is Movie]` are type filters. They check if the 'Content' instance is of a specific subtype, 'TVShow' or 'Movie' respectively. If the instance is of the type 'TVShow', it will include the 'num_seasons' property in the output. Similarly, if it's of the type 'Movie', it will include the 'release_year' property. This allows you to conditionally select properties based on the actual type of the content."}, {"human": "I see. Can you show me an example of how this might look in the schema definition?", "assistant": "Certainly! In the schema definition, you might have something like this: \n```sdl\ntype Content {\n  title: str;\n}\n\ntype TVShow extending Content {\n  num_seasons: int16;\n}\n\ntype Movie extending Content {\n  release_year: int16;\n}\n``` \nIn this schema, 'Content' is a base type with a 'title' property. 'TVShow' and 'Movie' are subtypes of 'Content' that add additional properties specific to each type."}, {"human": "Got it. So this query is a way to get a mixed list of movies and TV shows with their relevant details?", "assistant": "Exactly! The query is useful when you have a mixed collection of 'Content' instances and you want to retrieve a list that includes both 'TVShows' and 'Movies', along with their relevant properties. It's a concise way to get varied information in a single query."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how polymorphic queries work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, polymorphic queries allow you to query for objects of different types in a single query. This is particularly useful when you have a hierarchy of types and you want to select common properties along with type-specific properties. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example using TypeScript.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you have a type `Content` which is a base type for `Movie` and `TVShow`. You want to select the title for all content, but also the release year for movies and the number of seasons for TV shows. Here's how you could write that query in TypeScript using EdgeDB's client library:"}, {"human": "Okay, I'm following. Show me the code.", "assistant": "Here's the TypeScript code snippet for the polymorphic query you're interested in:\n```typescript\nconst query = e.select(e.Content, (content) => ({\n  title: true,\n  ...e.is(e.Movie, {release_year: true}),\n  ...e.is(e.TVShow, {num_seasons: true}),\n}));\n/* {\n  title: string;\n  release_year: number | null;\n  num_seasons: number | null;\n}[] */\n```\nIn this query, `e.select` is used to select from the `Content` type. The spread operator `...` is used to conditionally include properties from `Movie` and `TVShow` if the content is of that specific type. The result will be an array of objects where each object includes the `title` and, depending on the actual type, either `release_year`, `num_seasons`, or both as `null` if they don't apply."}, {"human": "I see, so the `...e.is` part is what makes it polymorphic?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `e.is` function is used to check if the selected object is an instance of a particular type, like `Movie` or `TVShow`. If it is, it includes the specified properties for that type in the result. This allows you to fetch different sets of properties based on the actual type of the object in a single query."}, {"human": "Got it. And what does the comment at the end of the code mean?", "assistant": "The comment at the end of the code is a TypeScript type annotation that describes the shape of the returned array. Each element in the array is an object with a `title` of type `string`. The `release_year` and `num_seasons` are optional and can be either a `number` or `null`. This reflects the polymorphic nature of the query, where some properties may not be present on all objects depending on their type."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or EdgeQL, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the 'group by' feature in EdgeQL. Can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Of course! The 'group by' feature in EdgeQL allows you to group records by a certain property. Here's an example where we group movies by their release year and select the title and actors' names: ```edgeql group Movie { title, actors: { name } } by .release_year; ```"}, {"human": "I see, but what if I want to count the number of movies released each year?", "assistant": "To count the number of movies released each year, you can use the 'count()' function along with 'group by'. Here's how you can modify the query: ```edgeql select (count(Movie), .release_year) group by .release_year; ```"}, {"human": "That's helpful, thanks! And how can I order the results by the year?", "assistant": "You're welcome! To order the results by year, you can add an 'order by' clause to the query like this: ```edgeql select (count(Movie), .release_year) group by .release_year order by .release_year; ```"}, {"human": "Got it. Can I also filter out movies released before 2000?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can add a 'filter' clause before the 'group by' to only include movies released after 1999: ```edgeql select (count(Movie), .release_year) filter .release_year > 1999 group by .release_year order by .release_year; ```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the group function in EdgeDB with TypeScript. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! The `group` function in EdgeDB is used to group records by a certain key. In TypeScript, you would use it to group your query results based on a specific property of the records. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example with movies and their release years.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's an example where we group movies by their release year using the `group` function in TypeScript:\n```typescript\ne.group(e.Movie, (movie) => {\n  const release_year = movie.release_year;\n  return {\n    title: true,\n    by: {release_year},\n  };\n});\n/* The result will be an array of objects with the following structure:\n{\n  grouping: string[]; // The grouping key, in this case, the release year\n  key: {\n    release_year: number | null; // The value of the release year used for grouping\n  };\n  elements: { title: string; }[]; // An array of movies grouped by the release year\n}[]\n*/\n```\nThis query will return an array of objects where each object contains a `grouping` key indicating the release year, a `key` object with the actual release year value, and an `elements` array with the titles of the movies released in that year."}, {"human": "What if the release year is not available for some movies?", "assistant": "If the release year is not available for some movies, the `release_year` in the `key` object will be `null`. The `group` function will still group those movies together under a `null` key. So you'll have a group where the `release_year` is `null` and the `elements` array will contain the movies without a release year."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And how can I access the grouped data in my TypeScript code?", "assistant": "Once you have executed the query with the `group` function, you can access the grouped data just like you would with any other array in TypeScript. Here's an example of how you might iterate over the grouped data:\n```typescript\nconst groupedMovies = e.group(e.Movie, (movie) => {\n  const release_year = movie.release_year;\n  return {\n    title: true,\n    by: {release_year},\n  };\n});\n\nfor (const group of groupedMovies) {\n  console.log(`Movies released in the year ${group.key.release_year}:`);\n  for (const movie of group.elements) {\n    console.log(movie.title);\n  }\n}\n```\nThis code will log the release year followed by the titles of the movies released in that year."}]}

What about finding the length of a string?", "assistant": "To find the length of a string, you can use the `len()` function. Here's an example:\n```edgeql\nselect len('oh hi mark');\n```\nThis will give you the length of the string, which is:\n```\n{10}\n```"}, {"human": "I see. And if I need to generate a unique identifier, is there a function for that?", "assistant": "Yes, there is. You can use the `uuid_generate_v1mc()` function to generate a version 1 UUID with a multicast MAC address. Here's how you do it:\n```edgeql\nselect uuid_generate_v1mc();\n```\nThis will generate a unique identifier like:\n```\n{c68e3836-0d59-11ed-9379-fb98e50038bb}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. What if I want to check if an array contains a certain element?", "assistant": "You can use the `contains()` function for that. It checks if the given array contains the specified element. Here's an example:\n```edgeql\nselect contains(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'd');\n```\nSince 'd' is not in the array, the result will be:\n```\n{false}\n```"}]}

EdgeQL is the query language for EdgeDB, and it's quite powerful. Here are a few simple examples to get you started:"}, {"human": "What's the EdgeQL equivalent of the NOT operator in SQL?", "assistant": "In EdgeQL, you can use the `not` operator to negate a boolean value. For example, if you want to negate `true`, you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect not true;\n```\nAnd the result would be `{false}`."}, {"human": "How can I check if a string exists or not?", "assistant": "To check for the existence of a string, or any value, you can use the `exists` operator. For instance, to check if the string 'hi' exists, you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect exists 'hi';\n```\nThe result of this query would be `{true}`, since the string 'hi' does indeed exist."}, {"human": "Can EdgeQL do basic arithmetic like addition?", "assistant": "Yes, EdgeQL can perform basic arithmetic operations. For example, to add two numbers, you can use the `+` operator:\n```edgeql\nselect 2 + 2;\n```\nThe result would be `{4}`."}, {"human": "What about string concatenation?", "assistant": "String concatenation in EdgeQL is done using the `++` operator. So if you want to concatenate 'Hello' and ' world!', you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect 'Hello' ++ ' world!';\n```\nThe result would be `{'Hello world!'}`."}, {"human": "Is there a way to do conditional expressions in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "Certainly! EdgeQL supports conditional expressions using the `if` statement. For example, if you want to return '\ud83d\ude04' when a condition is true and '\ud83d\ude22' when it's false, you can write:\n```edgeql\nselect '\ud83d\ude04' if true else '\ud83d\ude22';\n```\nSince the condition is `true`, the result would be `{'\ud83d\ude04'}`."}, {"human": "Can I also add time intervals together?", "assistant": "Yes, you can add time intervals in EdgeQL. For example, to add '5 minutes' to '2 hours', you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect '5 minutes' + '2 hours';\n```\nThe result would be `{'2:05:00'}`, representing a time interval of 2 hours and 5 minutes."}]}

The `str_upper()` function is used to convert the title to uppercase.\n5. `cast_size := count(.actors)` creates another computed field `cast_size` that contains the number of actors in the movie. This is done by counting the number of elements in the `actors` link.\n6. `};` closes the selection block and ends the query."}, {"human": "I see, so `title_upper` and `cast_size` are not actual fields in my database but are computed for each movie when I run this query?", "assistant": "Exactly! `title_upper` and `cast_size` are computed fields, which means they are calculated on the fly based on the existing data in your database when you run the query.

Here's how you can modify the query:\n\n```edgeql\nselect Person {\n  name,\n  acted_in := .<actors[is Content] {\n    title,\n    release_year\n  }\n}\nfilter count(Person.<actors[is Content]) > 3;\n```\n\nThis query will now only return persons who have acted in more than three pieces of content. The `count` function is used to count the number of `Content` items linked through the `actors` link, and the `filter` keyword applies the condition to the result set."}]}

Specifically, check out the 'Computed' and 'Backlinks' sections under the 'Select' chapter in the EdgeQL documentation. Would you like a brief explanation on these topics?"}, {"human": "Yes, please give me a brief overview.", "assistant": "Computed links are virtual links that you can define in your queries to compute values on the fly. They aren't stored in the database but are calculated at query time. Backlinks, on the other hand, are a way to traverse the relationship from the target type back to the source type. For example, if a `Movie` type has a link to `Person` for actors, you can use a backlink to find all movies a particular person has acted in."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the explanation!

Here's how you can write the query: ```edgeql UPDATE Movie FILTER .title = 'Doctor Strange 2' SET { title := 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' };```"}, {"human": "Great, that looks simple enough. But what if I only want to update the title if the movie was released after 2015?", "assistant": "You can add an additional condition to the `FILTER` clause to check the release year. Assuming your `Movie` type has a property for the release year, the query would look something like this: ```edgeql UPDATE Movie FILTER .title = 'Doctor Strange 2' AND .release_year > 2015 SET { title := 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' };```"}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I want to confirm that the update took place? Is there a way to get some feedback from the query?", "assistant": "Yes, the `UPDATE` statement returns the set of updated objects.

In EdgeDB, object-level constraints are used to enforce certain conditions on the data stored in the database.

Here's an example using SDL to define an object-level constraint on a `BlogPost` type:"}, {"human": "Could you show me the SDL example?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's how you would define an object-level constraint to ensure that the combination of `title` and `author` is unique for each `BlogPost`:"}, {"human": "Great, let me see the code.", "assistant": "```sdl\ntype BlogPost {\n  title: str;\n  author: User;\n  constraint exclusive on ((.title, .author));\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so this means that no two blog posts can have the same title and author, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `exclusive` constraint ensures that each `BlogPost` has a unique combination of `title` and `author`. If you try to insert a `BlogPost` with a `title` and `author` that already exist together in another `BlogPost`, EdgeDB will raise an error."}, {"human": "What about partial constraints? The documentation mentioned something about exceptions.", "assistant": "Partial constraints are a type of constraint that only apply to certain conditions. They allow you to specify an exception to the constraint rule. For example, you might want a `BlogPost` to have a unique title only if it's published. Let me show you how you could define a partial constraint for that."}, {"human": "Please do, I'd like to understand how to implement that.", "assistant": "Here's an example of a partial constraint using SDL. This constraint ensures that the title of a `BlogPost` is unique among all published blog posts, but it allows non-published posts to have duplicate titles:"}, {"human": "Can you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's the SDL code snippet for a partial constraint:"}, {"human": "I'm ready to see the example.", "assistant": "```sdl\ntype BlogPost {\n  title: str;\n  published: bool;\n  constraint exclusive on (.title) unless (.published = false);\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Ah, so the 'unless' part is where the exception is defined. That's pretty neat!", "assistant": "Exactly! The `unless` clause specifies the condition under which the constraint does not apply.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to optimize my database queries in EdgeDB. Can you explain how indexes work?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, you can define indexes on an object type to improve the performance of queries. Indexes are special data structures that the database uses to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a table."}, {"human": "I see. How do I create an index in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You can create an index using the `index on` clause within the definition of an object type in your schema. Here's an example using SDL (Schema Definition Language): \n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  required release_year: int64;\n  index on (.title);  # simple index\n  index on ((.title, .release_year));  # composite index\n  index on (str_trim(str_lower(.title)));  # computed index\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What's the difference between a simple index and a composite index?", "assistant": "A simple index is based on a single property, like the `title` of a movie. It helps speed up queries that filter or sort based on that property. A composite index, on the other hand, includes multiple properties. In the example, the composite index is on both `title` and `release_year`. This is useful for queries that involve filtering or sorting on the combination of those properties."}, {"human": "And what about the computed index? What does that do?", "assistant": "A computed index is based on an expression involving the properties of an object. In the example, the computed index is created on the trimmed and lowercased version of the movie titles. This can be particularly useful for case-insensitive searches or when you want to ignore leading and trailing whitespace in queries."}, {"human": "Got it. Is there anything else I should know about indexes?", "assistant": "Remember that while indexes can greatly improve query performance, they also come with a cost of additional storage and can affect the performance of insert and update operations, as the indexes need to be maintained. So, it's important to use them judiciously and consider the specific needs of your application."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what abstract types are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, an abstract type is a kind of template for other object types. It's not meant to be instantiated on its own, but other non-abstract types can extend it. This allows you to define common properties in one place and then reuse them across multiple types."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use an abstract type?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have different types of content like movies and TV shows, and they share some common properties, such as a title. You can create an abstract type called `Content` with a `title` property. Then, you can create non-abstract types like `Movie` and `TVShow` that extend `Content` and add their specific properties. Here's how it looks in SDL:\n``sdl\nabstract type Content {\n  required title: str;\n}\n\ntype Movie extending Content {\n  required release_year: int64;\n}\n\ntype TVShow extending Content {\n  required num_seasons: int64;\n}\n``"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. And what about multiple inheritance? Is that possible?", "assistant": "Yes, EdgeDB supports multiple inheritance. This means that a non-abstract type can extend more than one abstract type. For example, if you have another abstract type with additional properties, a non-abstract type can extend both `Content` and this new abstract type to inherit properties from both."}, {"human": "Could you show me an example of multiple inheritance?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you have another abstract type called `Taggable` that represents items that can have tags. You can have a `Movie` type that extends both `Content` and `Taggable` to include both titles and tags. Here's an example:\n``sdl\nabstract type Taggable {\n  multi tags: str;\n}\n\ntype Movie extending Content, Taggable {\n  required release_year: int64;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `Movie` will have a `title` from `Content`, a `release_year` specific to `Movie`, and `tags` from `Taggable`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand polymorphic links in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, polymorphic links are links that can refer to instances of different types. These types are usually derived from a common abstract type. This allows you to create a more flexible schema where a link can point to various kinds of related data."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to define a polymorphic link using SDL?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have an abstract type called `Content` which has a required `title` property. You then have two types, `Movie` and `TVShow`, that extend `Content` and have their own additional properties. You can then create a type `Franchise` with a polymorphic link `entries` that can point to any `Content` type, including `Movie` and `TVShow`. Here's how you would define it in SDL:\n```\nsdl\nabstract type Content {\n  required title: str;\n}\n\ntype Movie extending Content {\n  required release_year: int64;\n}\n\ntype TVShow extending Content {\n  required num_seasons: int64;\n}\n\ntype Franchise {\n  required name: str;\n  multi entries: Content;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "So in this case, `entries` can refer to both `Movie` and `TVShow`?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `entries` link in the `Franchise` type is polymorphic, meaning it can hold a set of `Content` items, which includes both `Movie` and `TVShow` instances. This is because both `Movie` and `TVShow` are extending the `Content` abstract type."}, {"human": "How would I query a franchise to get all its movies and TV shows?", "assistant": "You would use EdgeQL, the query language for EdgeDB. Here's an example query that retrieves the name of the franchise along with the titles of all its movies and TV shows:\n```\nSELECT Franchise {\n  name,\n  entries: {\n    title\n  }\n}\n```This query selects all `Franchise` instances and for each one, it gets the `name` and a set of `entries`, each with its `title`. Since `entries` is a polymorphic link, it will include both `Movie` and `TVShow` titles."}, {"human": "What if I only want to get the movies from a franchise?", "assistant": "To filter the entries so that only movies are retrieved, you can use a type filter in your query. Here's how you would do it:\n```\nSELECT Franchise {\n  name,\n  entries[IS Movie]: {\n    title,\n    release_year\n  }\n}\n```This query will return the `name` of each `Franchise` and a set of `entries` that are specifically `Movie` instances, including their `title` and `release_year`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to define a simple type for a movie in EdgeDB. Can you show me how to do that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can define a type for a movie using the Schema Definition Language (SDL). Here's a basic example where we define a type called 'Movie' with a single property 'title' that is of type 'str':\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  title: str;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That's great! But what if I want to make sure every movie has a title? Can I enforce that?", "assistant": "Yes, you can enforce that every movie has a title by making the 'title' property required. Here's how you would modify the SDL to make the title a required field:\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how would I go about adding more properties, like a release year?", "assistant": "To add more properties, you simply declare them within the type definition. For example, to add a 'release_year' property of type 'int32', you would write:\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  release_year: int32;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to add a description that can be quite long? Is there a text type or something similar?", "assistant": "Yes, for longer text, you can use the 'str' type, which is suitable for text of any length. If you want to add an optional 'description' property, you would do it like this:\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  release_year: int32;\n  description: str;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "This is really helpful, thanks! Where can I learn more about object types and properties in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You're welcome! To learn more about object types and properties in EdgeDB, you can check out the 'Schema' section in the EdgeDB documentation, specifically the 'Object types' subsection. It provides more detailed information and examples on how to define and work with types and properties."}]}

In EdgeDB, properties are optional by default. If you want to make a property required, you can use the `required` keyword. Here's an example of how you can define a `Movie` type with both required and optional properties:"}, {"human": "Okay, can you show me the example?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you would define a `Movie` type with a required `title` and an optional `release_year`:"}, {"human": "Great, let me see the code.", "assistant": "```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;       # required\n  release_year: int64;       # optional\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That looks simple enough. So if I don't put 'required' before a property, it's optional by default?", "assistant": "Exactly! Any property without the `required` keyword is considered optional. This means that when you insert data into the database, you don't need to provide a value for optional properties."}, {"human": "Got it. And if I try to insert a movie without a title, EdgeDB will give me an error, right?", "assistant": "Correct! Since `title` is a required property for the `Movie` type, EdgeDB will enforce that a value must be provided for it when inserting or updating a movie record. If you omit the `title`, EdgeDB will raise an error."}, {"human": "Thanks, that clears things up. I'll go ahead and define my movie schema now.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions while working on your schema or anything else related to EdgeDB, feel free to ask. Good luck with your project!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to define some rules for the properties of my data types in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can define constraints for properties to enforce certain rules. For example, if you want a property to be unique across all instances of a type, or to have a minimum length, or even match a regular expression, you can use constraints. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example with a movie title that needs to be unique and at least 8 characters long.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's how you would define a `Movie` type with a `title` property that is required to be unique, have a minimum length of 8 characters, and only contain alphanumeric characters: \n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str {\n    constraint exclusive;\n    constraint min_len_value(8);\n    constraint regexp(r'^[A-Za-z0-9]+$');\n  }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What does each constraint do in this case?", "assistant": "In the provided example, the `exclusive` constraint ensures that the `title` property is unique across all `Movie` instances. The `min_len_value(8)` constraint specifies that the `title` must be at least 8 characters long. Lastly, the `regexp(r'^[A-Za-z0-9]+$')` constraint enforces that the `title` only contains alphanumeric characters, which means no special characters or spaces are allowed."}, {"human": "Great, thanks! And what if I want to add a constraint that the title must start with a capital letter?", "assistant": "To ensure that the title starts with a capital letter, you can modify the regular expression in the `regexp` constraint like this: \n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str {\n    constraint exclusive;\n    constraint min_len_value(8);\n    constraint regexp(r'^[A-Z][a-z0-9]+$');\n  }\n}\n``` \nThis regular expression `r'^[A-Z][a-z0-9]+$'` dictates that the first character must be an uppercase letter from A to Z, followed by any combination of lowercase letters and numbers."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what computed properties are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! Computed properties in EdgeDB are properties of an object type that are calculated dynamically using an EdgeQL expression whenever they are queried. They are not stored in the database but are computed on-the-fly when requested."}, {"human": "That sounds interesting. Can you show me an example of how to define a computed property in SDL?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's an example of a computed property in the schema definition language (SDL) for a type called `Movie`. In this example, we have a computed property called `uppercase_title` that will return the movie's title in uppercase letters whenever it's queried.\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  uppercase_title := str_upper(.title);\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so `uppercase_title` is not actually stored in the database, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `uppercase_title` is not stored. It's computed using the `str_upper` function on the `title` property of the `Movie` type each time you query for it."}, {"human": "Can I use any EdgeQL expression for a computed property?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use any valid EdgeQL expression that returns a value compatible with the expected type of the computed property. The expression can include functions, operators, and references to other properties of the object."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how links work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, links are used to establish relationships between different object types. For example, if you have a `Movie` type and a `Person` type, you can create a link from `Movie` to `Person` to represent the director of the movie."}, {"human": "Could you show me an example of how to define these links in the schema?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example using SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  director: Person;\n}\n\ntype Person {\n  required name: str;\n}\n```In this schema, we have a `Movie` type with a required `title` property and a link to a `Person` which represents the director. The `Person` type has a required `name` property."}, {"human": "What if a movie can have more than one director?", "assistant": "If a movie can have multiple directors, you can use the `multi` keyword to indicate that the link can refer to multiple `Person` objects. Here's how you would define it:\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi directors: Person;\n}\n```This allows the `directors` link to reference more than one `Person`."}, {"human": "And what if a movie doesn't always have a cinematographer listed?", "assistant": "If a movie might not have a cinematographer, you don't need to use the `required` keyword for that link. It would look like this:\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  cinematographer: Person; # zero or one cinematographer\n}\n```This means that the `cinematographer` link is optional, and a `Movie` may or may not have a related `Person` as a cinematographer."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what computed links are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! Computed links in EdgeDB are expressions stored within an object type that return a set of objects. These links are not stored in the database but are dynamically computed each time they are referenced in a query. They can be used to define relationships based on calculations or conditions."}, {"human": "Interesting, do you have an example of how a computed link might look in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example of a computed link that defines a backlink. This is used in a `Movie` type to return all movies with the same title:\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n  # returns all movies with same title\n  multi same_title := (SELECT Movie FILTER .title = .<same_title[IS Movie].title);\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so this `same_title` computed link will give me all movies with the same title as the movie I'm querying?", "assistant": "Exactly! When you query a `Movie` object and include the `same_title` computed link, EdgeDB will calculate and return the set of `Movie` objects that have the same title as the one you're querying. It's a dynamic way to create relationships based on the data itself."}, {"human": "That's pretty cool. How would I use this in an actual query?", "assistant": "You would use it just like any other link in your EdgeQL queries. For example, if you want to find all movies with the same title as 'The Matrix', you could write a query like this:\n```edgeql\nSELECT Movie {\n  title,\n  same_title: {\n    title\n  }\n}\nFILTER .title = 'The Matrix';\n```"}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how backlinks work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, backlinks are a way to define a relationship from one entity to another in the reverse direction. For example, if you have a `Movie` type that has a link to `Person` entities through an `actors` link, you can define a computed link on the `Person` type to get all the `Movie` entities where that person has acted."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to define such a backlink?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you can define a backlink using SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n```sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n}\n\ntype Person {\n  required name: str;\n  multi acted_in := .<actors[is Movie];\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `acted_in` computed link on the `Person` type will return all `Movie` objects where the `actors` link includes the current `Person` instance."}, {"human": "So, what does the '.<actors[is Movie]' part mean?", "assistant": "The '.<actors[is Movie]' is a path expression that defines the backlink. The '.' refers to the current instance of `Person`. The '<' symbol indicates a reverse direction lookup. 'actors' is the link name in the `Movie` type that points to `Person`. The '[is Movie]' part is a type filter that ensures that only `Movie` objects are returned by the backlink, even though 'actors' could potentially link to other types as well."}, {"human": "I see. And how would I query this backlink using EdgeQL?", "assistant": "To query the `acted_in` backlink using EdgeQL, you could write a query like this:\n```edgeql\nSELECT Person {\n  name,\n  acted_in: {\n    title\n  }\n}\nFILTER .name = 'Some Actor';\n```\nThis query selects `Person` instances with a specific name and includes the titles of the movies they've acted in using the `acted_in` computed link."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how EdgeDB handles datetime precision. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, the types `datetime`, `duration`, `cal::local_datetime`, and `cal::relative_duration` all have a precision of 1 microsecond."}, {"human": "What does that mean for client libraries with higher precision, like nanoseconds?", "assistant": "When a client library has a native type with higher precision, such as nanoseconds, it has to round the timestamp to match EdgeDB's microsecond precision when encoding it."}, {"human": "How exactly is the rounding done?", "assistant": "EdgeDB uses rounding to the nearest even number when adjusting the precision. This means it will round to the nearest microsecond, and in the case of a tie, it will round to the nearest even microsecond."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how this rounding works?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a timestamp with nanosecond precision: `2023-03-25T12:34:56.123456789`. When this is encoded for EdgeDB, it would be rounded to `2023-03-25T12:34:56.123457` because `678` nanoseconds round up to the next microsecond."}, {"human": "What if the nanoseconds were `123456500` instead?", "assistant": "In that case, since the last three digits are `500`, which is exactly halfway between two microseconds, it would round to the nearest even microsecond. So `2023-03-25T12:34:56.123456500` would be rounded to `2023-03-25T12:34:56.123456`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand aggregate functions in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are?", "assistant": "Sure! Aggregate functions in EdgeDB are used to perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. For example, the `count()` function counts the number of elements in a given set."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use `count()`?", "assistant": "Absolutely! If you want to count the number of elements in a set, you can use `count()` like this:\n```edgeql\nselect count('hello');  # This will return {1}\n```\nThis is because 'hello' is considered a single element."}, {"human": "What if I have multiple items, like in a list or something?", "assistant": "If you have multiple items, you can put them in a set and then use `count()` to determine how many items are in that set. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect count({'this', 'is', 'a', 'set'});  # This will return {4}\n```\nThis counts each item in the set, resulting in 4."}, {"human": "What happens if the set is empty?", "assistant": "If the set is empty, `count()` will return 0, indicating that there are no elements in the set. Here's how it looks:\n```edgeql\nselect count({});  # This will return {0}\n```\nThis is useful for checking if a set has any elements at all."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand element-wise operations in EdgeDB. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, an element-wise operation is one that applies a function to each element of a set individually. For example, the `len()` function is element-wise. It computes the length of each string in a set of strings, resulting in a set of integers that represent the lengths of those strings."}, {"human": "So, if I have a set of different strings, `len()` will give me the length of each one separately?", "assistant": "Exactly! If you have a set of strings, calling `len()` on that set will give you a new set where each element is the length of the corresponding string from the original set. Here's an example using EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nselect len({'hello', 'world'});\n```\nThis query will return `{5, 5}`, because both 'hello' and 'world' have 5 characters."}, {"human": "What if I just have a single string? Will it still return a set?", "assistant": "Yes, even if you apply `len()` to a single string, EdgeDB treats it as a set with one element. So, if you run the query: \n```edgeql\nselect len('hello');\n```\nYou'll get `{5}` as the result, which is a set containing a single integer representing the length of the string 'hello'."}, {"human": "Got it! And I assume I can use `len()` with variables that are sets of strings too, right?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can use `len()` with any expression that results in a set of strings. If you have a variable that holds a set of strings, you can pass it to `len()` and get a set of integers representing the lengths of those strings."}, {"human": "Thanks for the explanation! I'll try this out in my EdgeDB project.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions while working on your project, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how cartesian products work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, when you perform element-wise operations that accept multiple arguments, the operation is applied to every combination of elements from all the input sets. This is known as a cartesian product. For example, if you concatenate two sets of strings, each string from the first set is concatenated with each string from the second set."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of this with string concatenation?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have two sets of strings: {'aaa', 'bbb'} and {'ccc', 'ddd'}. If you concatenate these sets using the '++' operator, you'll get the cartesian product of these sets concatenated together. Here's how you would write the query and the result you would get:\n```edgeql\nselect {'aaa', 'bbb'} ++ {'ccc', 'ddd'};\n```\nThe result would be a set containing {'aaaccc', 'aaaddd', 'bbbccc', 'bbbddd'}."}, {"human": "What about boolean operations? How do they work with cartesian products?", "assistant": "Boolean operations also work with cartesian products in EdgeDB. For example, if you use the 'or' operator with two sets of boolean values {true, false}, the operation is applied across the cartesian product of these sets. Here's an example query and its result:\n```edgeql\nselect {true, false} or {true, false};\n```\nThe result would be a set containing {true, true, true, false}, because 'true or true', 'true or false', and 'false or true' all evaluate to true, while 'false or false' evaluates to false."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about the 'in' operation in EdgeDB. Can you explain how it works with cardinality?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the 'in' operation is used to determine if a given element is part of a set. When you use 'in', it compares each element from the first set to the elements in the second set and returns a boolean value for each comparison."}, {"human": "So it's like checking each item one by one?", "assistant": "Exactly! It's an element-wise operation. For example, if you have a query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect {1, 4} in {1, 2, 3};\n```\nIt will check if '1' is in the set {1, 2, 3} and then if '4' is in the set {1, 2, 3}. The result will be a set of boolean values indicating the presence of each element in the second set: `{true, false}`."}, {"human": "What if the first set has more elements?", "assistant": "The number of elements in the first set doesn't change the basic operation. Each element in the first set is checked against the second set independently. So, if you have more elements, you'll just get more boolean results. For instance:\n```edgeql\nselect {1, 4, 5} in {1, 2, 3};\n```\nThis would result in `{true, false, false}`, since '1' is in the second set, but '4' and '5' are not."}, {"human": "And what happens if the second set is empty?", "assistant": "If the second set is empty, then none of the elements in the first set can be in it, so the result for each element will be 'false'. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect {1, 4} in {};\n```\nThis will return `{false, false}`, because neither '1' nor '4' can be found in an empty set."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how EdgeDB computes the cardinality of functions and operators. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the cardinality computation is used to determine the number of times a function or operator will be invoked based on the cardinality of its inputs. There are three types of cardinality transformations based on the type qualifier of each input: default element-wise, optional, and aggregate."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of each type?", "assistant": "Sure! For the default element-wise type, if you have an input with cardinality N, the function or operator will be invoked N times. This means that the output will have the same cardinality as the input. Here's a simple example:\n\n```edgedb\nSELECT len('hello'); # This will be invoked once because the input is a single string.\n```"}, {"human": "What about the optional type?", "assistant": "For the optional type, if the input has cardinality N, the output cardinality will be `max(1, N)`. This means that if the input is empty (cardinality 0), the output will still be invoked once. Here's an example:\n\n```edgedb\nSELECT <OPTIONAL str>{}; # This will have a cardinality of 1, even though the input is empty.\n```"}, {"human": "And the aggregate type?", "assistant": "With the aggregate type, no matter what the cardinality of the input is, the output cardinality will always be 1. This is because aggregate functions combine multiple values into a single result. Here's an example:\n\n```edgedb\nSELECT count(User); # No matter how many User items there are, the result is a single integer.\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. So the cardinality affects how many times the function or operator is called?", "assistant": "Exactly! The cardinality determines the number of invocations. For element-wise operations, it's the same as the input cardinality. For optional, it's at least one, and for aggregates, it's always one, regardless of the input cardinality."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how type casting works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, you can convert a value from one type to another using a type cast expression. This is useful when you want to explicitly change the type of a value. For example, if you have an integer and you want to treat it as a string, you can cast it."}, {"human": "Okay, how do I actually do that? Is there a special syntax?", "assistant": "Yes, there is a specific syntax for casting. You use the `<` symbol followed by the type you want to cast to. For instance, if you want to cast an integer to a string, you would write it like this in an EdgeQL query: `select <str>10;`. This will return the integer 10 as a string."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me an example of how that would look in the EdgeDB REPL?", "assistant": "Certainly! In the EdgeDB REPL, you would enter the query like this:\n```\n db> select <str>10;\n```\nAnd the output would be the string \"10\". The REPL will display it as `{\"10\"}` to indicate that it's a string value."}, {"human": "Are there any restrictions on what types I can cast to?", "assistant": "Yes, there are some restrictions. The type you're casting to must be a valid type expression denoting a non-abstract scalar or a container type. So you can cast to basic types like integers, strings, or to arrays and tuples, but not to abstract types or object types."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or type casting, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm a bit confused about implicit casts in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are?", "assistant": "Sure! Implicit casts in EdgeDB occur automatically when the type of a value doesn't match the expected type in an expression. This is mostly used for numeric types where there's no potential loss of information, such as casting from a less precise numeric type to a more precise one."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of where an implicit cast might happen?", "assistant": "Certainly! Let's say you have an `int64` value and you're using it in a context where a `float64` is expected. EdgeDB will automatically cast the `int64` value to `float64` because there's no loss of information when converting from an integer to a floating-point number."}, {"human": "I see. So, does this mean I can mix `int64` and `float64` in calculations without worrying about the types?", "assistant": "Exactly! When you perform calculations that involve both `int64` and `float64` values, EdgeDB will handle the necessary casts for you. For example, if you add an `int64` value to a `float64` value, the result will be a `float64` without you having to explicitly cast the `int64` value."}, {"human": "Got it. Are there any cases where implicit casts would not be supported?", "assistant": "Yes, implicit casts are not supported when there's a risk of information loss. For example, casting from a `float64` to an `int64` could result in truncation of the decimal part, so EdgeDB won't perform such a cast implicitly. In cases where you need to convert between types that could result in information loss, you'd have to use explicit casting."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to remove objects from an EdgeDB database. Can you explain how the delete statement works?", "assistant": "Certainly! The `delete` statement in EdgeQL is used to remove objects from the database. Here's the basic syntax for it:\n```edgeql\ndelete [ filter <filter_condition> ] [ order by <order_expression> [direction] [then ...] ] [ offset <number> ] [ limit <number> ];\n```"}, {"human": "What does the `with` clause do in this context?", "assistant": "The `with` clause is used for alias declarations. It allows you to specify module aliases and expression aliases that can be referenced later in the `delete` statement. This can be useful for simplifying complex queries or when you need to reference the same expression multiple times within your `delete` statement."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of a delete statement with a filter condition?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a `User` type and you want to delete users who have the username 'JohnDoe'. The delete statement with a filter condition would look like this:\n```edgeql\ndelete User filter .username = 'JohnDoe';\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to delete only a few objects after ordering them?", "assistant": "If you want to delete objects after ordering them, you can use the `order by` clause followed by `limit` to specify the number of objects you want to delete. For example, if you want to delete the three oldest users, you could write:\n```edgeql\ndelete User order by .signup_date asc limit 3;\n```This will order the users by their signup date in ascending order and delete the first three."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to delete a specific user named Alice Smith from my database using EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can delete a specific user by using the `delete` statement in EdgeQL. Here's a simple example of how you can do it:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me the code?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the EdgeQL command you would use:\n```edgeql\nwith module example\ndelete User filter User.name = 'Alice Smith';\n```"}, {"human": "What does the 'with module example' part mean?", "assistant": "The `with module example` part specifies that you are using the `example` module. It's a way to set the default module for the subsequent EdgeQL statements, so you don't have to prefix the `User` type with `example::` each time."}, {"human": "I see. Is there another way to write this delete statement?", "assistant": "Yes, there's an alternative syntax where you can use a `select` statement inside the `delete` statement. It looks like this:\n```edgeql\nwith module example\ndelete (select User filter User.name = 'Alice Smith');\n```"}, {"human": "Is there any difference between the two methods?", "assistant": "Functionally, both methods achieve the same result \u2013 they delete the user named 'Alice Smith'. The difference is mostly syntactical. The first method is more direct, while the second method explicitly selects the user before deleting. In some cases, using `select` can be more flexible if you need to perform more complex queries before deletion."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the explanation! I'll try it out.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance with EdgeDB, feel free to ask. Good luck with your database operations!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the 'describe' command works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me with an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'describe' command in EdgeDB is used to get the DDL (Data Definition Language) statements that define a particular object in the database schema, such as a type, function, or module. Let's take a look at an example schema to illustrate this:"}, {"human": "Sure, show me the example.", "assistant": "Here's a simple schema definition using SDL (Schema Definition Language): \n```sdl\nabstract type Named {\n    required name: str {\n        delegated constraint exclusive;\n    }\n}\n\ntype User extending Named {\n    required email: str {\n        annotation title := 'Contact email';\n    }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Okay, I see there's an abstract type 'Named' and a type 'User' that extends it. What does the 'describe' command do with this?", "assistant": "If you want to see how the 'User' type is defined in DDL, you would use the 'describe' command in the EdgeDB REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Here's how you would call it:\n```edgeql-repl\ndb> describe object User;\n```\nThis command will output the DDL statements that define the 'User' type, including any inherited properties and annotations."}, {"human": "What will the output look like?", "assistant": "The output will provide the DDL statement necessary to recreate the 'User' type in another database. It will include the definition of the 'name' property from the 'Named' abstract type, the 'email' property specific to the 'User' type, and any annotations or constraints associated with these properties."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of the output?", "assistant": "I'm sorry, but I can't execute commands or show the actual output of the 'describe' command. However, I can tell you that the output will be a text representation of the 'User' type's schema definition, which you can use to understand the structure of your database or to recreate the schema elsewhere."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand EdgeQL and its evaluation algorithm. Can you explain what it means when they say EdgeQL is a functional language?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeQL, being a functional language means that every expression you write is essentially a composition of queries. These queries can be either explicit or implicit. An explicit query is one that you write out, like a `select` statement. An implicit query is one that's inferred by the language based on the context, such as within a function or operator, or as part of a statement clause."}, {"human": "I see. Can you give me an example of an implicit query?", "assistant": "Sure! An implicit query happens when the language assumes a `select` subquery based on the context of how you're using a function or operator. For example, if you have a function that expects a set of elements as an argument, and you pass it a single link property, EdgeQL will implicitly convert that link property into a set by assuming a `select` subquery around it."}, {"human": "That's interesting. Could you show me a code snippet to illustrate this?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you have a type `Person` with a multi link to `Movie` called `acted_in`. If you want to get the count of movies a person has acted in, you might write a function call like this:\n\n```\nselect Person {\n  name,\n  movie_count := count(acted_in)\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, `count(acted_in)` is an implicit query. EdgeQL understands that `acted_in` is a link property that refers to multiple `Movie` objects, so it automatically wraps it in a `select` to treat it as a set of `Movie` objects before counting."}, {"human": "Got it, that makes sense. So the language is doing some of the work for me behind the scenes. Thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "Exactly! EdgeQL is designed to be smart about understanding the context of your queries, which can make your code more concise and easier to read. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use the 'union' with 'for' in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can use the 'union' operator within a 'for' loop to perform operations like INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE. The 'union' operator is used to combine the results of multiple queries into a single set. When you use 'union' in the context of a 'for' loop, you're typically iterating over a set of elements and applying an operation to each element."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use 'union' with 'INSERT' in a 'for' loop?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example where we use a 'for' loop to iterate over a set of elements and insert a new User for each element in the set. The variable 'x' represents the current element in the iteration:\n```\nfor x in {('Alice', 'light'), ('Bob', 'dark')} union (\n    insert User {\n        name := x.0,\n        theme := x.1,\n    }\n);\n```In this example, 'x' is a tuple with two elements, where 'x.0' is the name and 'x.1' is the theme. For each tuple in the set, we insert a new User with the corresponding name and theme."}, {"human": "What does it mean when the documentation says 'x is an element of a set'?", "assistant": "When the documentation mentions that 'x is an element of a set', it's referring to the fact that 'x' represents a single element from the set you're iterating over in the 'for' loop. In the context of the 'for' loop, 'x' is guaranteed to be a non-empty singleton, which means it will always have exactly one value in each iteration. This is important because it ensures that the expressions used by the 'union' and later clauses of 'for' are applied to a single, well-defined element."}, {"human": "What would happen if the set was empty?", "assistant": "If the set you're iterating over with the 'for' loop is empty, then the 'for' loop would not execute the body of the loop at all. In the context of our previous example, if the set was empty, no 'User' entries would be inserted into the database because there would be no elements to iterate over and apply the 'insert' operation to."}]}

The command only updates existing records that match the filter criteria."}, {"human": "Got it. And this will run in a single transaction?", "assistant": "Yes, the entire `FOR` statement with the `union` and `update` commands will run as a single transaction.

In EdgeDB, you can call a function by specifying its name followed by parentheses containing the arguments. If the function takes named arguments, you can prefix the argument with its name and the assignment operator `:=`. For example, to compute the length of a string 'foo', you would call the `len` function like this:\n```edgeql\nselect len('foo');\n```\nThis will return `{3}`, which is the length of the string 'foo'."}, {"human": "What if I want to use a named argument?

You would first define a variable and then use it as an argument in the function call. For example:\n```edgeql\nwith price as {100}\nselect calculate_discount(amount := price);\n```\nIn this snippet, `price` is a variable set to `100`, and it's being used as the argument for the `calculate_discount` function."}]}

Would you like to see an example of how it's structured?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's a simplified representation of the output structure you would get when using the `group` statement in EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\n{\n  \"key\": { := [, ...] },\n  \"grouping\": <expression>,\n  \"elements\": <expression>,\n}\n```\nThe `\"key\"` part contains another free object, which includes the expressions that you're grouping by. The `\"grouping\"` is the expression that defines how you're grouping the data, and `\"elements\"` represents the actual data that fits into each group."}, {"human": "I see. Can you give me a practical example with actual data?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say we have a database of movies and we want to group them by the year they were released and count how many movies were released each year. Here's how you might write that query in EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nSELECT Movie {\n  year_released,\n  count := count(Movie)\n}\nGROUP BY .year_released;\n```\nThis query will return a set of objects where each object has a 'year_released' key and a 'count' of how many movies were released in that year."}, {"human": "Got it. And how would the output look like?", "assistant": "The output would be a set of free objects, each corresponding to a group. For example, if we had movies released in 1999, 2000, and 2001, with 2, 5, and 3 movies released in each year respectively, the output might look something like this: \n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"key\": {\"year_released\": 1999},\n    \"grouping\": 1999,\n    \"elements\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"key\": {\"year_released\": 2000},\n    \"grouping\": 2000,\n    \"elements\": 5\n  },\n  {\n    \"key\": {\"year_released\": 2001},\n    \"grouping\": 2001,\n    \"elements\": 3\n  }\n]\n```Each object represents a group, with the 'year_released' as the key and the number of movies as the elements."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeQL or anything else related to EdgeDB, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to group data in EdgeDB. Can you show me a simple example?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can group data using the `group ... by` construct. Here's a straightforward example where we group movies by their release year without any aggregation:"}, {"human": "Okay, how does that look in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "Here's how you would write the query in EdgeQL:\n```edgeql\nSELECT group Movie {title} by .release_year;\n```\nThis query groups the `Movie` type by the `release_year` property and selects the `title` of each movie in the groups."}, {"human": "What does the output of this query look like?", "assistant": "The output will be a set of groups where each group is associated with a release year. Each group will contain movies released in that year. Here's an example of what the output might look like:\n```\n{\n  {\n    key: {release_year: 2016},\n    grouping: {'release_year'},\n    elements: {\n      default::Movie {title: 'Captain America: Civil War'},\n      default::Movie {title: 'Doctor Strange'},\n    }\n  }\n  // ... other groups for different years\n}\n```\nIn this output, we have a group for the year 2016 containing 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'Doctor Strange'."}, {"human": "That's pretty clear. Can I also select additional properties, not just the title?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can select any properties you need. For instance, if you wanted to select both the title and the director of the movies, you would adjust the query like this:\n```edgeql\nSELECT group Movie {title, director} by .release_year;\n```\nThis would include both the title and director in the elements of each group."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to insert new data into an EdgeDB database. Can you explain how the insert command works?", "assistant": "Certainly! The `insert` command in EdgeQL is used to create a new object in the database. The basic syntax looks like this: ```edgeql INSERT TypeName { field1 := value1, field2 := value2, ... };``` You replace `TypeName` with the name of the type you're inserting, and `field1`, `field2`, etc., with the names of the fields you're setting, along with their respective values."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to insert a new movie into a database?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a type `Movie` with fields `title` and `release_year`. To insert a new movie, you would write: ```edgeql INSERT Movie { title := 'Inception', release_year := 2010 };``` This command creates a new `Movie` object with the title 'Inception' and a release year of 2010."}, {"human": "What if I only want to insert the movie if it doesn't already exist?", "assistant": "EdgeDB provides a way to handle that using the `unless conflict` clause. Here's how you can use it: ```edgeql INSERT Movie { title := 'Inception', release_year := 2010 } UNLESS CONFLICT ON .title ELSE (SELECT Movie);``` This command will insert the new movie only if there isn't already a movie with the title 'Inception'. If there is a conflict, it will select the existing movie instead."}, {"human": "Great, thanks! And what if I want to include some conditional logic before the insert, like setting a variable?", "assistant": "You can use the `WITH` clause to define variables or perform some computation before the insert. For example: ```edgeql WITH year := 2010 INSERT Movie { title := 'Inception', release_year := year };``` This sets a variable `year` to 2010 and then uses it in the insert command."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the 'insert' command in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'insert' command in EdgeDB is used to create a new object in the database. When you use 'insert', you specify the type of the object you want to create, and then you provide the values for its properties and links."}, {"human": "So, how exactly does the 'insert' command work? Do I need to provide values for all properties?", "assistant": "When you use 'insert', you only need to provide values for the required properties and links. If a property or link is optional, you can omit it. However, if you don't provide a value for a required link and it evaluates to an empty set, EdgeDB will raise an error."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me an example of how to insert a single object?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a type called 'Person' with a required property 'name'. Here's how you would insert a new person into the database:\n```\ninsert Person {\n  name := 'Alice'\n};\n```"}, {"human": "That looks simple enough. What if I want to insert multiple objects at once?", "assistant": "To insert multiple objects, you can use a comma-separated list of objects within the 'insert' block. For example:\n```\ninsert Person {\n  name := 'Alice'\n},\nPerson {\n  name := 'Bob'\n};\n```"}, {"human": "I see. And what happens if I don't provide a value for a required property?", "assistant": "If you omit a value for a required property or if the value for a required link is an empty set, EdgeDB will not insert the object and will return an error. It's important to ensure that all required fields are provided when inserting new objects."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to add new entries to my database using EdgeDB. Can you show me a simple example?", "assistant": "Of course! To insert a new entry into your database, you can use the `insert` statement. Here's a simple example of creating a new user named 'Bob Johnson' in a module named 'example':\n```edgeql\nwith module example\ninsert User {\n  name := 'Bob Johnson'\n};\n```"}, {"human": "That looks straightforward. But what if I want to insert something else, like an issue with a number?", "assistant": "You can insert any type of object in a similar way. For example, if you want to insert an 'Issue' with a specific number, you would write something like this:\n```edgeql\nwith module example\ninsert Issue {\n  number := 42\n};\n```Just replace '42' with the actual issue number you want to assign."}, {"human": "Got it. And what happens after I run the insert command?", "assistant": "`insert` is not only a statement but also an expression. This means it has a value, which is the set of objects that have been created. So after you run the `insert` command, you can actually use the result as part of another query if needed."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of using the result of an insert in another query?", "assistant": "Certainly! Let's say you want to insert a new 'Issue' and then immediately select its ID. You could do it like this:\n```edgeql\nwith module example\nselect (insert Issue {\n  number := 99\n}).id;\n```This query inserts a new 'Issue' and then selects the 'id' of the newly created 'Issue'."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to do a bulk insert in EdgeDB. Can you explain how it works with an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can perform a bulk insert by using the `insert` statement within a `for` loop that iterates over a set of elements. Here's an example where we insert multiple `Issue` objects based on a query that selects users with names starting with 'A':"}, {"human": "Okay, can you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the EdgeQL code snippet for the bulk insert operation:\n```\nmodule example {\n    Elvis := (select User filter .name = 'Elvis'),\n    Open := (select Status filter .name = 'Open')\n    for Q in (select User filter .name ilike 'A%')\n    union (insert Issue {\n        name := Q.name + ' access problem',\n        body := 'This user was affected by recent system glitch',\n        # ... other fields like status or owner can be set here using 'Elvis' and 'Open' variables\n    })\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see. So, what does the 'Elvis' and 'Open' part do?", "assistant": "In this example, 'Elvis' and 'Open' are variables that represent specific objects from the database. 'Elvis' is a user whose name is 'Elvis', and 'Open' is a status object with the name 'Open'. These variables are defined at the beginning and can be used later in the `insert` statement to set fields like the owner or status of the new `Issue` objects."}, {"human": "Got it. And the 'for Q in (select User filter .name ilike 'A%')' part is the query for the bulk insert?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `for Q in (select User filter .name ilike 'A%')` part is a loop that iterates over a set of `User` objects whose names start with the letter 'A'. For each user in this set, the `insert` statement creates a new `Issue` object with a name and body derived from the user's name. The `union` keyword is used to combine all the `insert` operations into a single bulk insert command."}, {"human": "And what if I want to add more fields to the Issue during the insert?", "assistant": "You can add more fields to the `Issue` object within the `insert` statement. Just make sure to provide the values for those fields. For example, if you want to set the status and owner of the issue, you could modify the `insert` statement like this:\n```\ninsert Issue {\n    name := Q.name + ' access problem',\n    body := 'This user was affected by recent system glitch',\n    status := Open, # assuming 'Open' is a Status object\n    owner := Elvis # assuming 'Elvis' is a User object\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how string literals work in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, string literals can be defined in several ways. You can use single or double quotes for regular strings, or you can use raw strings which are useful when you want to include escape characters as part of the string itself. Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some examples of both regular and raw strings.", "assistant": "Alright, here are some examples for you:\n\nRegular strings can be enclosed in single or double quotes:\n```\nSELECT 'This is a regular string in single quotes';\nSELECT \"This is a regular string in double quotes\";\n```\n\nRaw strings are prefixed with an 'r' and can be enclosed in single or double quotes as well:\n```\nSELECT r'This is a raw string in single quotes';\nSELECT r\"This is a raw string in double quotes\";\n```\n\nRaw strings don't process escape sequences like '\\n' for newline, they treat them as plain text. Do you want to see how to use dollar-quoted strings as well?"}, {"human": "Yes, what are dollar-quoted strings and how do I use them?", "assistant": "Dollar-quoted strings are a way to define string literals that might contain a lot of special characters or span multiple lines without needing to escape them. They start and end with a dollar sign followed by zero or more characters (forming a 'tag'), and then another dollar sign. The tag must be the same at the beginning and the end of the string. Here's an example:\n```\nSELECT $$This is a dollar-quoted string without a tag$$;\n\nSELECT $tag$This is a dollar-quoted string with a 'tag'$tag$;\n```\n\nThese are especially useful for writing long strings or strings that contain quotes. Does that help clarify things?"}, {"human": "It does, thanks! So if I have a string with both single and double quotes, I should use a dollar-quoted string?", "assistant": "Exactly! Using a dollar-quoted string allows you to include both single and double quotes in your string without the need for escaping them. For example:\n```\nSELECT $$He said, \"This is EdgeDB's cool feature!\"$$;\n```\nThis makes it much easier to work with complex strings. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm having trouble with string constants in EdgeQL. Can you explain how dollar-quoted strings work?", "assistant": "Certainly! Dollar-quoted strings are a special type of raw string in EdgeQL that allow you to include quotes within the string without needing to escape them. You start and end a dollar-quoted string with a pair of dollar signs, and you can also include an optional 'tag' of alphanumeric characters between the dollar signs for additional clarity."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of a dollar-quoted string?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example without a tag:\n```\nSELECT $$This is a dollar-quoted string with 'single quotes' and \"double quotes\" inside.$$;\n```\nAnd here's an example with a tag:\n```\nSELECT $tag$This is a dollar-quoted string with a tag that includes 'single quotes' and \"double quotes\".$tag$;\n```"}, {"human": "What's the point of using a tag?", "assistant": "Using a tag can be helpful when the string itself contains sequences of dollar signs. By using a unique tag, you ensure that the string is correctly delimited. The tag makes the start and end delimiters distinct, so there's no confusion about where the string starts and ends, even if dollar signs are used within the string content."}, {"human": "Is there a limit to what I can use as a tag?", "assistant": "The tag can be any sequence of alphanumeric characters, and it's case-sensitive. Just make sure that the tag you use does not appear within the string content itself. Otherwise, it would prematurely terminate the string. There's no limit to the length of the tag, but it's usually best to keep it short and relevant to the context."}, {"human": "Got it. So if I have a string that contains $$, I should use a tag to avoid issues?", "assistant": "Exactly! If your string contains dollar signs, using a tag is a good practice. For example:\n```\nSELECT $money$This string contains $$ which could be mistaken for the end of the string without a tag.$money$;\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand the difference between int64 and bigint in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, there are two types of integer constants. The `int64` type is a limited size integer, which means it has a maximum value it can store. On the other hand, `bigint` is an unlimited size integer, which can represent much larger numbers."}, {"human": "How do I write a bigint literal in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "To write a `bigint` literal, you simply take a regular integer literal and append an 'n' suffix to it. For example, `123n` would be a `bigint` literal."}, {"human": "What are the rules for writing these integer literals?", "assistant": "The rules for writing integer literals are as follows: For `bigint`, you write the integer followed by an 'n'. For a regular integer, you can write a zero '0' or any non-zero digit followed by any number of digits. A non-zero digit can be any digit from 1 to 9."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of both int64 and bigint?", "assistant": "Sure! An example of an `int64` literal would be `42`, and an example of a `bigint` literal would be `42n`. The `int64` literal is just a plain number, while the `bigint` literal has the 'n' suffix to indicate its unlimited size."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand the difference between float64 and decimal in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `float64` represents a limited precision floating-point number, similar to a double in other programming languages. On the other hand, `decimal` is used for unlimited precision real numbers, which means it can represent very large or very small numbers with exact precision."}, {"human": "I see. How do I write a decimal constant in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "To write a decimal constant, you use the same format as a `float64` but with an `n` suffix. For example, `123.456n` is a decimal constant, whereas `123.456` would be considered a `float64`."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me how to define a property with a decimal type in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example of how you would define a property with a decimal type in SDL:\n```\ntype Product {\n  price: decimal;\n}\n```This defines a `Product` type with a `price` property that will store decimal values."}, {"human": "And what about float64?", "assistant": "For a `float64` property, you would define it like this:\n```\ntype Product {\n  weight: float64;\n}\n```This will create a `weight` property for the `Product` type that stores limited precision floating-point numbers."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the 'select' statement in EdgeQL. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! The 'select' statement in EdgeQL is used to retrieve or compute a set of values from the database. It's similar to the SELECT statement in SQL if you're familiar with that. The basic structure of a 'select' statement includes optional clauses like 'with', 'filter', 'order by', 'offset', and 'limit'. Would you like to see a simple example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me a basic example.", "assistant": "Sure, let's say you have a type 'Person' in your database and you want to retrieve all persons whose age is over 30. Here's how you would write that using the 'select' statement with a 'filter' clause:\n```edgeql\nselect Person\nfilter .age > 30;\n```The 'filter' clause is where you specify a condition that must be true for each element in the set to be included in the result. In this case, we're filtering to include only persons older than 30."}, {"human": "What if I want to sort the results?", "assistant": "To sort the results, you can use the 'order by' clause. For example, if you want to sort the persons by their age in descending order, you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect Person\nfilter .age > 30\norder by .age desc;\n```You can add 'asc' for ascending order or 'desc' for descending order after the property you're sorting by. You can also chain sorting conditions using 'then'."}, {"human": "Can I limit the number of results returned?", "assistant": "Yes, you can limit the number of results using the 'limit' clause. For instance, if you only want to get the first 10 persons over the age of 30, you would add 'limit 10' at the end of your query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Person\nfilter .age > 30\norder by .age desc\nlimit 10;\n```This will return at most 10 persons who are over the age of 30, sorted by age in descending order."}, {"human": "And what about skipping some results, like for pagination?", "assistant": "For pagination, you can use the 'offset' clause to skip a certain number of results. For example, to skip the first 20 persons and then get the next 10, you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect Person\nfilter .age > 30\norder by .age desc\noffset 20\nlimit 10;\n```This query will skip the first 20 results and then return the next 10 persons, which is useful for implementing pagination in your application."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the 'limit' clause works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'limit' clause in EdgeDB is used to restrict the number of results returned by a query. It essentially slices the filtered or ordered set to the specified number of items. For example, if you want to get only the first 10 items from a query result, you would use the 'limit' clause like this:\n```\nselect Movie\norder by .release_date desc\nlimit 10;\n```"}, {"human": "I see. Does using 'limit' affect the order of the results in any way?", "assistant": "Good question! The 'limit' clause does not affect the order of the results. However, it's important to note that the `order by` clause defines an ordering that can only be relied upon if the resulting set is not used in any other operation. The exceptions to this rule are the `select`, `offset`, and `limit` clauses, as they preserve the inherent ordering of the underlying set."}, {"human": "So, if I understand correctly, if I use 'order by' and then 'limit', the order will be preserved, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! When you use 'order by' followed by 'limit', the order specified by 'order by' will be preserved in the limited set of results. Here's an example to illustrate:\n```\nselect Person\norder by .last_name\nlimit 5;\n```\nIn this query, the first 5 persons will be returned based on the alphabetical order of their last names."}, {"human": "What if I want to skip the first few results and then apply 'limit'?", "assistant": "In that case, you would use the 'offset' clause in conjunction with 'limit'. The 'offset' clause skips a specified number of results, and then 'limit' will apply to the remaining set. Here's how you can skip the first 5 results and then get the next 10:\n```\nselect Movie\norder by .release_date desc\noffset 5\nlimit 10;\n```"}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how the 'filter' clause works in EdgeQL. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! Think of the 'filter' clause as a function that takes two arguments: the first is the result set from the preceding clause, and the second is a set of conditions that you want to apply to this result set. The 'filter' clause will then return a new result set that only includes the elements that meet the specified conditions."}, {"human": "So, does that mean I can use 'filter' to affect aggregate functions in my 'select' clause?", "assistant": "No, the 'filter' clause cannot affect anything aggregate-like in the preceding 'select' clause. Aggregate functions like 'count', 'sum', 'avg', etc., are computed over the entire result set before the 'filter' is applied. So, the 'filter' only affects which items are included in the result set, not the calculation of aggregates."}, {"human": "Got it. Could you show me an example of how to use 'filter' in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a 'Movie' type and you want to select movies that have a rating higher than 7.5. Here's how you might write that query using the 'filter' clause:\n```\nselect Movie {\n    title,\n    rating\n}\nfilter .rating > 7.5;\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. And the filter is applied after the select clause has determined what to include in the result set, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The 'select' clause first determines the shape of the result set, including which fields and objects to retrieve. After that, the 'filter' clause is applied to this result set to exclude any items that do not meet the filter conditions."}]}

Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some examples.", "assistant": "Sure thing! If you want to reset a specific module, you can use the command `reset module;`. For example, if you've set a default module in your session and want to revert back to no default module, you'd use this command."}, {"human": "What if I want to reset an alias I've created?", "assistant": "To reset a specific alias, you would use `reset alias <alias_name>;`.

For example, if you have a global variable named `current_user_id`, you can reset it back to its default value using the following command: `reset global current_user_id;`"}, {"human": "Great, thanks! Where can I learn more about these commands?", "assistant": "You're welcome! To learn more about the `reset` command and other EdgeQL commands, you can refer to the EdgeDB documentation, specifically the EdgeQL section under 'Reference'. It will provide you with more details and examples."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use session-level parameters in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are?", "assistant": "Certainly! Session-level parameters in EdgeDB are settings that you can configure for the duration of your database session. They affect how the database behaves for your current connection. For example, you can set the default module, so you don't have to specify it in each query, or create aliases for modules to shorten the queries."}, {"human": "That sounds useful. How do I set the default module?", "assistant": "To set the default module, you can use the `set module` command. Here's how you do it:\n```edgeql\nSET MODULE <module_name>;\n```\nReplace `<module_name>` with the name of the module you want to set as default."}, {"human": "Got it. And what about creating an alias for a module?", "assistant": "Creating an alias for a module can be done with the `set alias` command. Here's the syntax:\n```edgeql\nSET ALIAS <alias_name> AS MODULE <module_name>;\n```\nJust replace `<alias_name>` with the alias you want to create and `<module_name>` with the actual module name you want to refer to."}, {"human": "Is there a way to set global parameters too?", "assistant": "Yes, you can set global parameters using the `SET` command followed by the parameter name and the value you want to assign to it. The syntax looks like this:\n```edgeql\nSET <parameter_name> := <value>;\n```\nMake sure to replace `<parameter_name>` with the name of the global parameter and `<value>` with the value you want to set."}, {"human": "This is great, thanks! Can you give me an example of setting a global parameter?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you want to set a global parameter named 'my_param' to the value '123'. You would use the following command:\n```edgeql\nSET my_param := 123;\n```\nThis command sets 'my_param' to 123 for the duration of your current session."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how to use global variables in EdgeDB. Can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can set a global variable using the `set global` command. For example, if you want to set a global variable named `my_variable` to the value `42`, you would write the following EdgeQL command: ```edgeql\nset global my_variable := 42;```"}, {"human": "Great, thanks! And how would I use this global variable in a query?", "assistant": "You can use the global variable in your queries by referencing it with the `$` sign. For instance, if you want to filter a set of items where a property matches the global variable `my_variable`, you could write something like this: ```edgeql\nselect Item filter .property = $my_variable;```"}, {"human": "I see. Can you also show me how to cast a variable to a specific type in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "Of course! To cast a variable to a specific type in EdgeQL, you use the `::<Type>` syntax. For example, if you have a variable `bar` and you want to cast it to a type `FooType`, you would write: ```edgeql\nselect bar::FooType;```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. Is there anything special I need to know about casting?", "assistant": "When casting, just make sure that the value you're trying to cast is compatible with the target type. If the cast is not possible, EdgeDB will raise an error. It's also worth noting that casting can be used in expressions, not just in `select` statements."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use modules and aliases in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can set the current module to avoid having to specify it in each query. You can also create aliases for modules to shorten the names you have to type. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you can set the current module to 'foo':\n```edgeql\nset module foo;\n```\nAnd if you want to create an alias for the 'std' module as 'foo', you can do it like this:\n```edgeql\nset alias foo AS module std;\n```"}, {"human": "What about setting global variables? Is that possible?", "assistant": "Yes, you can set global variables in EdgeDB. For instance, if you want to set a global variable named 'current_user_id', you can do it like this:\n```edgeql\nset global current_user_id := '00ea8eaa-02f9-11ed-a676-6bd11cc6c557';\n```"}, {"human": "Great, thanks! And how do I reset these settings if I need to?", "assistant": "To reset the settings, you can use the `RESET` command. For example, to reset the module, alias, or global variable, you would use:\n```edgeql\nRESET MODULE;\nRESET ALIAS foo;\nRESET GLOBAL current_user_id;\n```\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the 'Reset' section in the EdgeQL reference of the EdgeDB documentation."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand what shapes are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a _shape_ is a construct used to describe type variants in queries, the data in `insert` and `update` statements, and to specify the output format of statements. Think of it as a way to select and structure the data you want to retrieve or modify."}, {"human": "Can you show me what a shape looks like in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "Of course! A shape follows an expression and is a list of _shape elements_ enclosed in curly braces. Here's the basic syntax for a shape:\n```edgeql\n{\n    <shape_element>,\n    ...\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What's a shape element?", "assistant": "A shape element can be a property or link of the type you're shaping. It can also include nested shapes to further specify the structure of the data. For example, if you have a `Movie` type and you want to shape a query to get the title and release year, it would look like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Movie {\n    title,\n    release_year\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Can you include a nested shape in that example?", "assistant": "Absolutely! If the `Movie` type has a link to `Person` for the director, and you want to include the director's name in the shape, you would nest a shape for the `Person` type like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Movie {\n    title,\n    release_year,\n    director: {\n        name\n    }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "This is helpful. Can shapes be used in insert statements too?", "assistant": "Yes, shapes can also be used in `insert` statements to specify the data you want to insert. For example, to insert a new movie with its title and director, you would use a shape like this:\n```edgeql\ninsert Movie {\n    title := 'Inception',\n    release_year := 2010,\n    director := (insert Person {\n        name := 'Christopher Nolan'\n    })\n}\n```"}, {"human": "And what about update statements?", "assistant": "Shapes in `update` statements work similarly. They let you specify which properties or links to update. Here's how you would update the release year of a movie:\n```edgeql\nupdate Movie\nset {\n    release_year := 2012\n}\nwhere .title = 'Inception';\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how shapes work in EdgeDB. Can you explain the general shaping rules to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, when you use a `select` statement to retrieve data, the shape you specify determines the structure of the output. This means that the fields and nested shapes you include in your `select` query will be reflected in the results you get back."}, {"human": "So, if I understand correctly, if I shape my query a certain way, the output will match that shape exactly?", "assistant": "Exactly! The output will mirror the shape of your query. This applies to all shapes, no matter how they are nested, including within arrays. For example, if you aggregate users into an array with their names, like this:\n```edgeql\nselect array_agg(User {name});\n```\nThe output will be an array of `User` objects with the `name` property included, like so:\n```\n{\n  [\n    default::User {name: 'Alice'},\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So if I want to include multiple properties or links, I just add them to the shape in the select statement?", "assistant": "That's right! You can include as many properties and links as you need in the shape. Just list them inside the curly braces. For instance, if you want to select users with their names and email addresses, you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect User {\n  name,\n  email\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to include a nested object, like the user's posts?", "assistant": "To include nested objects, you would nest the shape of the related object inside the parent shape. For example, to include a user's posts, you could write:\n```edgeql\nselect User {\n  name,\n  email,\n  posts {\n    title,\n    content\n  }\n};\n```This query would return users with their names, email addresses, and an array of their posts, each with a title and content."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And this shaping rule applies no matter how deeply nested the data is?", "assistant": "Yes, the shaping rule applies at all levels of nesting. No matter how deep the nesting goes, the output will reflect the shape you've specified in your `select` statement."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I was reading about EdgeDB and came across the term 'losing shapes'. Can you explain what that means?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a 'shape' refers to the set of fields that you select from an object or a set of objects, similar to selecting columns from a table in SQL. However, there are certain operations that can cause you to lose this shape information, either completely or partially."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of an operation that would cause shape loss?", "assistant": "Sure! One common operation that can lead to losing shapes is the `union` operation. When you perform a union of two or more sets with different shapes, the resulting set may not preserve the original shapes of the individual sets. This is because the union operation combines the sets and needs to reconcile differences in their shapes."}, {"human": "So, how do I prevent losing the shape when using `union`?", "assistant": "To prevent losing the shape when using `union`, you need to ensure that the original expression type is preserved. This means that the fields you select from each set in the union should be consistent. If the shapes are different, you may need to explicitly select common fields or use type casting to align the shapes before performing the union."}, {"human": "I see. Could you show me an example with some code?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you have two types, `Movie` and `Series`, with different properties. If you want to union them without losing shape, you would select common fields like this:\n\n```edgeql\nSELECT (\n    WITH\n        M := (SELECT Movie {id, title, release_year}),\n        S := (SELECT Series {id, title, release_year})\n    UNION (M, S)\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, both `Movie` and `Series` have the fields `id`, `title`, and `release_year` selected, so the shape is preserved in the union."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to finalize a transaction in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can finalize a transaction by using the `commit` command. It will commit all the changes made in the current transaction to the database."}, {"human": "Could you show me how to use the `commit` command in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "Sure! It's quite simple. Here's how you use the `commit` command in EdgeQL: ```edgeql commit; ``` Just run this command when you're ready to commit your changes."}, {"human": "Is there anything else I need to do before running commit?", "assistant": "Before you run `commit`, make sure that all the operations you wanted to perform in the transaction are complete. Once you commit, the changes are permanent. If you're using a client integration, the transaction might be managed by the client's API, so check the documentation for the specific client you're using."}, {"human": "What happens if I realize I made a mistake and don't want to commit?", "assistant": "If you decide not to commit because of a mistake or for any other reason, you can roll back the transaction. To do this, you would use the `rollback` command instead of `commit`. This will undo all changes made in the current transaction."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm working with EdgeDB and I need to know how to commit the current transaction. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can commit the current transaction by using the EdgeQL command `commit;`. Here's how you can do it:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me the exact command?", "assistant": "Sure, here it is:\n```edgeql\ncommit;\n```Just run this command when you're ready to commit your changes."}, {"human": "That looks simple enough. What happens after I run this command?", "assistant": "Once you run the `commit;` command, all the changes you made in the current transaction will be permanently saved to the database. After committing, the transaction is closed, and you would need to start a new transaction to make further changes."}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I start a new transaction after committing?", "assistant": "To start a new transaction, you can use the `start transaction;` command. Like this:\n```edgeql\nstart transaction;\n```This will begin a new transaction for you to work with."}, {"human": "Thanks for the help! I'll try these commands out.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance with EdgeDB, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm a bit confused about how transactions work in EdgeDB. Can you explain how to abort a transaction?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, if you want to abort the current transaction and discard all the changes made in it, you can use the `rollback` command. This will undo all the operations performed in the transaction. Here's how you use it in EdgeQL: ```edgeql\nrollback;\n```"}, {"human": "So, if I run some commands to modify the database and then decide I don't want those changes, I just run `rollback;`?", "assistant": "Exactly! Running `rollback;` will revert all the changes made in the current transaction. It's a way to ensure that if something goes wrong or if you change your mind, you can cancel all the modifications without affecting the database."}, {"human": "Is there anything special I need to do before I can use `rollback;`?", "assistant": "Before you can use `rollback;`, you need to make sure that you're operating within a transaction. Transactions are usually started with the `START TRANSACTION;` command or implicitly when you execute a query. Once you're within a transaction, you can use `rollback;` at any point to abort it."}, {"human": "Got it. And after I use `rollback;`, can I start a new transaction immediately?", "assistant": "Yes, after rolling back a transaction, you can start a new one right away with `START TRANSACTION;`. This allows you to attempt your operations again or proceed with different operations in a new transaction."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm working with EdgeDB and I need to know how to abort a transaction I'm currently in. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! If you want to abort the current transaction in EdgeDB, you can use the `ROLLBACK` command. Here's how you do it: ```edgeql ROLLBACK; ```"}, {"human": "Great, that looks simple enough. So I just run this command in the EdgeDB console?", "assistant": "Yes, exactly. You run that command in the EdgeDB console or in your EdgeDB client where you're executing your EdgeQL commands. It will immediately abort and roll back any changes made in the current transaction."}, {"human": "What happens if I've made several changes in the transaction before I run ROLLBACK?", "assistant": "When you run `ROLLBACK`, all the changes you've made in the current transaction will be undone. It's as if those changes were never made, so you can start fresh with a new transaction."}, {"human": "Is there anything else I need to know about aborting transactions?", "assistant": "Just remember that once you've rolled back a transaction, you can't recover the changes that were aborted. So make sure you really want to discard those changes before you execute `ROLLBACK`. Otherwise, it's a straightforward command."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use transactions in EdgeDB. Can you explain what a savepoint is?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a savepoint is a way to set a 'checkpoint' within a transaction. If you encounter an error after the savepoint, you can rollback to that savepoint without aborting the entire transaction. It's a way to partially undo some work if you need to, without losing everything you've done in the transaction so far."}, {"human": "That sounds useful. How do I declare a savepoint in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "To declare a savepoint, you use the `declare savepoint` command within a transaction. Here's the syntax:\n```edgeql\nDECLARE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;\n```\nReplace `savepoint_name` with the name you want to give to your savepoint."}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I use this savepoint if I need to rollback?", "assistant": "If you need to rollback to a savepoint, you would use the `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` command followed by the name of the savepoint. Like this:\n```edgeql\nROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;\n```\nThis will undo all the changes made after the savepoint was declared, but keep the changes made before it."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about savepoints?", "assistant": "Just remember that savepoints are only valid within the transaction where they were declared. Once you commit or rollback the entire transaction, the savepoints are no longer available. Also, you can declare multiple savepoints within the same transaction to handle different parts of your transaction with more granularity."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use savepoints in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are and how to release them?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, a savepoint is a way to set a 'restore point' during a transaction. This allows you to roll back to that point if something goes wrong, without having to roll back the entire transaction. To release a savepoint, which means you're confident with the changes made after it and no longer need the option to roll back to it, you can use the `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` command. Here's the syntax: ```edgeql release savepoint <savepoint_name>; ```"}, {"human": "Got it. So if I have a savepoint named 'sp1', how do I release it?", "assistant": "To release the savepoint named 'sp1', you would use the following EdgeQL command: ```edgeql release savepoint sp1; ``` This tells EdgeDB that you no longer need the savepoint 'sp1' and it can be discarded."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to release a savepoint that doesn't exist?", "assistant": "If you try to release a savepoint that doesn't exist, EdgeDB will return an error indicating that the savepoint you're trying to release is not found. It's important to ensure that the savepoint name you're releasing matches exactly with the one you've created earlier in the transaction."}, {"human": "Is there anything else I should know about using savepoints?", "assistant": "Just remember that savepoints are used within the context of a transaction. You should first start a transaction, then create savepoints as needed. After releasing a savepoint, you can't roll back to it, but you can still roll back to any remaining savepoints or to the beginning of the transaction. Also, when the transaction is committed or rolled back entirely, all savepoints are automatically released."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm a bit confused about how to use savepoints in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a savepoint is a way to set a named point within a transaction that you can roll back to without affecting the rest of the transaction. It's like a checkpoint in your transaction that you can return to if something goes wrong after you've created the savepoint."}, {"human": "I see. How do I create a savepoint?", "assistant": "To create a savepoint, you use the `savepoint` command followed by the name you want to give to that savepoint. Here's a simple example:\n```edgeql\nsavepoint my_savepoint;\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I roll back to a savepoint if I need to?", "assistant": "If you need to roll back to a savepoint, you use the `rollback to savepoint` command followed by the name of the savepoint you want to roll back to. Here's how you would roll back to the savepoint named 'my_savepoint':\n```edgeql\nrollback to savepoint my_savepoint;\n```"}, {"human": "Does rolling back to a savepoint end the transaction?", "assistant": "No, rolling back to a savepoint does not end the transaction. It only reverts the changes made after the savepoint was created. The transaction remains open, and you can continue to make changes or commit the transaction when you're ready."}, {"human": "What happens if I commit the transaction after rolling back to a savepoint?", "assistant": "When you commit the transaction after rolling back to a savepoint, all the changes you made before the savepoint and after rolling back will be saved. Any changes that were made after the savepoint and before the rollback will be discarded."}, {"human": "That's clear now. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

Would you like to see a simple example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of starting a transaction and then rolling it back.", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you can start a transaction and then roll it back in EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nstart transaction;\nselect 'Hello World!';\nrollback;\n``` \nIn this example, we start a new transaction, execute a select statement, and then roll back the transaction, which means the select statement's effects, if any, will not be saved."}, {"human": "What if I want to start a transaction with specific characteristics, like making it serializable?", "assistant": "You can start a transaction with specific isolation levels and other characteristics. For example, to start a serializable, read-only, and deferrable transaction, you would use the following EdgeQL command: \n```edgeql\nstart transaction isolation serializable, read only, deferrable;\n``` \nThis command starts a transaction where the isolation level is set to 'serializable', which is the strictest level, ensuring that the transaction behaves as if it is the only one interacting with the database. It's also read-only and deferrable, meaning it cannot make changes and will defer constraint checks until the end of the transaction."}, {"human": "Great, thanks! Where can I find more information about transactions in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You can find more detailed information about transactions in the EdgeDB documentation. Specifically, you can look into the 'Reference > EdgeQL > Commit', 'Reference > EdgeQL > Rollback', and other related sections for more in-depth explanations and examples."}]}

And what's the 'with' clause for?", "assistant": "The `with` clause is used for alias declarations. It allows you to specify module aliases or common expressions that you can reuse in the rest of the query. For example: ```edgeql\nwith CurrentUser := (select User filter .id = <SpecificUserID>)\nupdate CurrentUser set { email := 'new.email@example.com' };\n``` This way, you define `CurrentUser` as an alias for the selection of the user with the specific ID, and then you use it in the update expression."}, {"human": "That makes sense.

You can write your query like this:\n```\nwith module movie\nselect Movie {\n  title,\n  release_year\n}\n```In this query, `Movie`, `title`, and `release_year` are all assumed to be part of the `movie` module."}, {"human": "What happens if I don't specify a module and the identifier isn't found in the 'std' module?", "assistant": "If you don't specify a module and the identifier isn't found in the 'std' module, EdgeDB will raise an error indicating that the identifier is undefined. It's important to either specify the module or ensure that the identifiers you're using are part of the 'std' module or are otherwise properly scoped."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I need to use identifiers from multiple modules in one query?", "assistant": "In that case, you can still use the `with module` construct to set a default module, but you'll need to explicitly specify the module for identifiers that are not part of the default module. Here's an example:\n```\nwith module movie\nselect Movie {\n  title,\n  release_year,\n  director: person::Person { name }\n}\n```In this query, `Movie`, `title`, and `release_year` are in the default `movie` module, while `Person` is explicitly scoped to the `person` module with `person::Person`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what a 'detached' expression is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a `detached` expression is used to refer to a set as if it were defined independently of the current query context. It's like taking a step back and looking at the data without any of the filters or relationships that might be applied in the current scope of the query."}, {"human": "I see, but can you give me an example of how that works in practice?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a query where you're filtering a list of movies by a certain director, but within that query, you want to count all movies in the database, not just the ones by that director. You could use a `detached` expression to do this. Here's a simple example:\n\n```edgeql\nwith\n  D := (select Director filter .name = 'Christopher Nolan'),\n  C := (select count(detached Movie))\nselect (\n  director_movies := (select D.<directs),\n  total_movies := C\n);\n```"}, {"human": "Got it, so the `detached` keyword allows me to count all movies, not just the ones related to 'Christopher Nolan' in this case?", "assistant": "Exactly! Without `detached`, the count would be scoped to the current context, which is the set of movies directed by Christopher Nolan. By using `detached`, you're telling EdgeDB to count all `Movie` entries as if you're running a separate, top-level query."}, {"human": "That's pretty neat. Does it work with module aliases as well?", "assistant": "Yes, `detached` expressions do take into account module aliases. So if you have defined a module alias in a `with` block at the top of your query, you can use that alias within the `detached` expression."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example with a module alias?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you have a module alias `M` for the module containing the `Movie` type. You could write a query like this:\n\n```edgeql\nmodule default;\n\nwith\n  M := module default,\n  D := (select Director filter .name = 'Christopher Nolan'),\n  C := (select count(detached M::Movie))\nselect (\n  director_movies := (select D.<directs),\n  total_movies := C\n);\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the clarification!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the 'with' block works in EdgeQL. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! The 'with' block in EdgeQL is used to define aliases for expressions. When you create an alias, it's evaluated in the lexical scope where it appears, not where it's used later in the query. This is important to remember when refactoring queries, as moving things around could change the meaning of your query. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, an example would be great, thanks!", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you have a query where you want to calculate the average movie rating and then select movies that have a rating above this average. Here's how you might use the 'with' block to do that:\n```eql\nwith average_rating := (select avg(Movie.rating))\nselect Movie {\n    title,\n    rating\n} filter .rating > average_rating\n```In this example, `average_rating` is an alias for the average rating subquery, and it's used in the filter condition to only select movies with a rating above the average."}, {"human": "I see, so the 'average_rating' is calculated first and then used in the filter. What happens if I use the alias in a different part of the query?", "assistant": "The alias `average_rating` will still represent the value that was calculated in the 'with' block, regardless of where you use it in the query. However, you need to be careful when moving the alias definition around. If you change the lexical scope of the alias definition, it might change the result of the calculation. For example, if you define `average_rating` inside a subquery or a different 'with' block, it might be calculated differently based on the new context."}, {"human": "Got it, so the context where I define the alias is crucial. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "Exactly! Always pay attention to the context of your aliases to maintain the correct semantics of your query. You're welcome, and if you have any more questions about EdgeQL or anything else, feel free to ask!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use modules in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are and how to use them?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a module is a namespace that groups related database objects like types, functions, and indexes. By default, everything you define is part of the `default` module. However, you can create custom modules to organize your schema more effectively. To use a module within a query, you can specify it using the `module` keyword inside a `with` block. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of how to use the `module` keyword.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you have a module named `movie` and you want to select all items of type `Movie` within that module. Here's how you would write the query in EdgeQL: \n```eql\nwith module movie\nselect Movie;\n``` \nThis `with` block tells EdgeDB that `Movie` refers to the `Movie` type within the `movie` module, not the `default` module."}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I define a new module in my schema?", "assistant": "To define a new module in your schema, you use the Schema Definition Language (SDL). Here's a simple example where we define a module called `movie` and a type `Movie` within that module: \n```sdl\nmodule movie {\n  type Movie {\n    required title -> str;\n    release_year -> int16;\n  }\n}\n``` \nThis SDL snippet creates a new module named `movie` and a type `Movie` with a required `title` property and an optional `release_year` property."}, {"human": "That's clear now. Can I define multiple modules in the same SDL file?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can define as many modules as you need in the same SDL file. Just make sure to start each module definition with the `module` keyword followed by the module name and curly braces containing the definitions for that module. Here's an example with two modules: \n```sdl\nmodule movie {\n  type Movie {\n    required title -> str;\n    release_year -> int16;\n  }\n}\n\nmodule actor {\n  type Actor {\n    required name -> str;\n    birth_year -> int16;\n  }\n}\n``` \nThis defines two separate modules, `movie` and `actor`, each with their own types."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about the 'detached' keyword in EdgeQL. Can you explain what it does?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'detached' keyword in EdgeQL is used to mark an expression as not belonging to any scope. This means that the expression is evaluated independently of the current query context."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how 'detached' is used?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a query where you want to select movies, but you also want to include a count of all movies in the database, regardless of any filters applied to the main query. Here's how you might write it:\n```eql\nSELECT Movie {\n  title,\n  all_movies_count := count(detached Movie)\n}\n```In this example, `detached Movie` is used to count all movies in the database, independently of the main `SELECT Movie` query."}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So without 'detached', the count would be limited to the scope of the movies selected by the query?", "assistant": "Exactly! Without 'detached', the count would only include the movies that are being selected by the current query. By using 'detached', you're telling EdgeQL to evaluate the count in the global scope, which includes all movies in the database."}, {"human": "That's really helpful. Are there any restrictions on using 'detached'?", "assistant": "The main thing to keep in mind is that 'detached' expressions are evaluated independently, so they don't have access to variables or context from the surrounding query. Other than that, you can use 'detached' whenever you need to perform a subquery that should not be influenced by the current query context."}, {"human": "Got it. Thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeQL or any other aspect of EdgeDB, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use aliases in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work with an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, an alias is a way to create a virtual type that extends or modifies an existing type without actually altering the original schema. For example, if you have a 'User' type and you want to create an alias that includes additional computed information, you can declare an alias like this:"}, {"human": "Okay, can you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you would declare an alias named 'UserAlias' that adds a computed link 'friend_of' to the existing 'User' type:"}, {"human": "Great, let me see the code.", "assistant": "```sdl\nalias UserAlias := User {\n    # declare a computed link\n    friend_of := User.<friends[is User]\n};\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so what does the 'friend_of' computed link do?", "assistant": "The 'friend_of' computed link is a way to traverse the relationship from another 'User' back to this 'UserAlias'. It's using a backlink from the 'friends' link of the 'User' type. The '[is User]' part is a type filter that ensures that only 'User' objects are considered when computing the 'friend_of' link."}, {"human": "Got it. So this 'UserAlias' will now have all the properties and links of 'User' plus the 'friend_of' link?", "assistant": "Exactly! The 'UserAlias' will include everything from the 'User' type, and it will also have the additional 'friend_of' computed link that you can use in your queries."}, {"human": "Thanks, that makes sense. How would I use this alias in a query?", "assistant": "You would use 'UserAlias' just like you would use any other type in your queries. For example, if you want to select all users along with their friends, you could write a query like this:\n```edgeql\nSELECT UserAlias {\n    id,\n    name,\n    friend_of: {\n        id,\n        name\n    }\n};\n```"}, {"human": "That's really helpful.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to define an alias in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, an alias is a way to create a shorthand for a more complex query. You can define an alias using the SDL (Schema Definition Language). The basic syntax for defining an alias looks like this: ```sdl alias <alias_name> := <expression>; ```"}, {"human": "I see. Could you give me an example of how to define an alias?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you frequently need to retrieve movies that have a rating higher than 7.5. You can define an alias for this query like this: ```sdl alias PopularMovies := (SELECT Movie FILTER .rating > 7.5); ``` Now, you can use `PopularMovies` in your queries to refer to this subset of the `Movie` type."}, {"human": "That's pretty handy. What if I want to include some additional filtering or sorting when I use the alias?", "assistant": "You can define an alias with parameters to make it more flexible. Here's an example: ```sdl alias MoviesByRating(minimum_rating: float64) := (SELECT Movie FILTER .rating > minimum_rating); ``` Now, when you use `MoviesByRating`, you can pass a specific rating to filter the movies, like this: ```edgeql SELECT MoviesByRating(8.0); ```"}, {"human": "Got it. And what does the part with the square brackets mean in the syntax?", "assistant": "The square brackets in the syntax indicate that the contents inside them are optional. In the context of defining an alias, it means you can optionally include additional elements such as filters or ordering. For example: ```sdl alias MoviesByGenre(genre: str) := { using (SELECT Movie FILTER .genre = genre); [order by .release_date desc] }; ``` This defines an alias with an optional ordering clause. If you include the `order by` part when using the alias, it will sort the results by release date in descending order."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for explaining aliases to me!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to add some notes to my database schema for the admin to see. Is there a way to do that in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can declare custom annotations to add notes or metadata to your schema. Here's how you can declare a new annotation:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you define a new annotation called 'admin_note':\n```sdl\nabstract annotation admin_note;\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I use this annotation for a specific type in my schema?", "assistant": "You can specify the value of an annotation for a type like this:\n```sdl\ntype Status {\n    annotation admin_note := 'system-critical';\n    required name: str {\n        constraint exclusive\n    }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "This 'exclusive' constraint, what does it do?", "assistant": "The 'exclusive' constraint ensures that the value of the 'name' property is unique across all instances of the 'Status' type. In other words, no two 'Status' objects can have the same name."}, {"human": "I see. And where can I learn more about annotations and constraints?", "assistant": "You can learn more about annotations, constraints, and other EdgeDB features in the official EdgeDB documentation. It provides a comprehensive guide on how to use these features effectively in your schema design."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use constraints in EdgeDB. Can you explain abstract and concrete constraints?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, constraints are used to define rules that data must satisfy within the database. An abstract constraint is a template that you can define once and then apply to multiple fields or types. It's not directly enforced until it's used in a concrete constraint."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of an abstract constraint?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example of an abstract constraint that ensures a value is greater than or equal to a specified minimum value:\n```sdl\nabstract constraint min_value(min: anytype) {\n    errmessage := 'Minimum allowed value for {__subject__} is {min}.';\n    using (__subject__ >= min);\n}\n```"}, {"human": "How would I use that abstract constraint in a real scenario?", "assistant": "To use the abstract constraint, you would declare a concrete constraint on a specific type. For instance, if you want to create a scalar type for positive integers, you could do it like this:\n```sdl\nscalar type posint64 extending int64 {\n    constraint min_value(0);\n}\n```This creates a new scalar type called `posint64` that extends the built-in `int64` type, and it applies the `min_value` constraint to ensure that the value is always 0 or greater."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to insert a value that violates this constraint?", "assistant": "If you attempt to insert a value into a field of type `posint64` that is less than 0, EdgeDB will raise an error and the insertion will be rejected. The error message will be the one defined in the abstract constraint, which in this case is 'Minimum allowed value for {__subject__} is {min}.'"}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the explanation! I think I understand constraints in EdgeDB now.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use extensions in EdgeDB. Can you explain how to declare that my schema is using a particular extension?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, if you want to use an extension within your schema, you need to declare it explicitly. This is done using the `using extension` statement in SDL (Schema Definition Language). Here's the basic syntax for it:\n```\nsdl\nusing extension <extension_name>;\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So if I wanted to use, let's say, the 'uuid-ossp' extension, how would I write that?", "assistant": "If you want to use the 'uuid-ossp' extension, you would include the following line at the beginning of your SDL file:\n```\nsdl\nusing extension 'uuid-ossp';\n```This line tells EdgeDB to enable the 'uuid-ossp' extension for your schema."}, {"human": "Is there anything else I need to do after declaring the extension?", "assistant": "After declaring the extension in your SDL file, you just need to apply the schema changes. You can do this by running the `edgedb migrate` command if you're using migrations, or by applying the SDL file directly to your database. Once applied, you'll be able to use the functionality provided by the extension in your schema."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help! I'll try that out.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or run into any issues while working with EdgeDB, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I heard about EdgeDB and its GraphQL capabilities. Can you tell me how to enable GraphQL for my schema?", "assistant": "Absolutely! To enable GraphQL for your current schema in EdgeDB, you just need to include a simple line in your schema definition language (SDL) file. Here's how you do it:\n```\nsdl\nusing extension graphql;\n```"}, {"human": "That's great, thanks! And what if I want to use EdgeQL over HTTP? Is there a similar way to enable that?", "assistant": "Yes, there is. To enable EdgeQL over HTTP for your database, you would use a similar line in your SDL file. Here's the code snippet for that:\n```\nsdl\nusing extension edgeql_http;\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So I just need to add these lines to my SDL file and that's it?", "assistant": "Exactly! Just add those lines at the beginning of your SDL file to enable the respective extensions. After that, you can start using GraphQL and EdgeQL over HTTP with your EdgeDB database."}, {"human": "Awesome, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to create a custom function in EdgeDB that appends the length of a string to the end of that string. Can you show me how to do that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can declare a custom function using SDL (Schema Definition Language).

But there's a typo in the function body, right? It should be 'len(s)' instead of 'len(a)'.", "assistant": "You're absolutely correct, that was a typo. The correct SDL for the function should use 'len(s)' to get the length of the input string 's'. Here's the corrected version: \n```sdl\nfunction foo(s: str) -> str\n    using (\n        select s ++ len(s)\n    );\n```"}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And how would I call this function in an EdgeQL query?", "assistant": "To call the custom function 'foo' in an EdgeQL query, you would use the following syntax: \n```edgeql\nSELECT foo('Your input string');\n``` \nThis will return the input string with its length appended at the end."}, {"human": "Perfect, I'll try that out.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I came across a 'using future;' statement in an EdgeDB SDL file. What does it do?", "assistant": "The 'using future;' statement in an SDL file is used to declare that the current schema enables a particular future behavior.

Here's a simple example of how you might use 'using future;' in an SDL file:\n\n```sdl\nusing future;\n\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What happens if I don't include 'using future;' in my SDL?", "assistant": "If you don't include 'using future;' in your SDL, then your schema will be interpreted with the default behaviors of the current version of EdgeDB. This means you won't be able to use any of the new features or behaviors that require opting in with 'using future;'."}, {"human": "Is there anything I should be cautious about when using 'using future;'?", "assistant": "Yes, when you use 'using future;', you're opting into behaviors that might not be fully supported or might change in future releases. It's important to keep this in mind, especially if you're working on a production system. Always check the EdgeDB documentation for the specific future behaviors you're enabling to understand their implications."}]}

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use global variables in EdgeDB. Can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can declare a new global variable using the Schema Definition Language (SDL).

It means that the value of the global variable will only persist for the duration of the current database session. If you disconnect and start a new session, you'll need to set the global variable again."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the clarification! Is there anything else I should know about using global variables?", "assistant": "You're welcome! Just remember that global variables are a powerful feature that can help you manage state at the session level. They can be particularly useful for access control or for storing user preferences during a session.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I've heard about EdgeDB and I'm curious about how to define its schema. Can you tell me more about it?", "assistant": "Absolutely! EdgeDB uses a Schema Definition Language, or SDL, to define its schema. SDL is a high-level, declarative language that's optimized for human readability and expressiveness. It allows you to describe the structure of your database in a clear and concise way."}, {"human": "So, what's the difference between SDL and DDL?", "assistant": "SDL, or Schema Definition Language, is used to define the schema declaratively. This means you describe what the schema should look like without specifying the operations to get there. On the other hand, DDL, or Data Definition Language, is an imperative language that specifies the exact commands to modify the schema, like creating or altering tables. In EdgeDB, there's a correspondence between the declarative SDL and the imperative DDL."}, {"human": "I see. Could you show me a simple example of what SDL looks like in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a basic example of SDL where we define a type 'Movie' with a title and a link to multiple actors of type 'Person':\n``sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title -> str;\n  multi actors -> Person;\n}\n``\nIn the latest syntax, we would write it like this:\n``sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n}\n``"}, {"human": "Got it, that looks pretty straightforward. How would I go about adding a new property to the 'Movie' type?", "assistant": "To add a new property to the 'Movie' type, you would simply extend the SDL definition for 'Movie'. For example, if you want to add a release year, you could do it like this:\n``sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n  release_year -> int64;\n}\n``\nAnd with the updated syntax:\n``sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n  release_year: int64;\n}\n``"}, {"human": "That's great! And how would I define a relation between 'Movie' and 'Person'?", "assistant": "To define a relation between 'Movie' and 'Person', you would use links. In the example we've been working with, the 'actors' field is a link to the 'Person' type, representing a many-to-many relationship. If you wanted to add a director to the movie, which is a one-to-one relationship, you could add another link like this:\n``sdl\ntype Movie {\n  required title: str;\n  multi actors: Person;\n  release_year: int64;\n  director: Person;\n}\n``"}]}

Comments in SDL start with a `#` and are ignored by EdgeDB when defining the schema."}, {"human": "Got it. And what does 'multi' mean in the context of the actors field?", "assistant": "The keyword `multi` indicates that the `actors` link can reference multiple `Person` objects. This means that a `Movie` can have several actors associated with it, reflecting the many-to-many relationship between movies and actors."}, {"human": "Makes sense. And what about the 'required' keyword?", "assistant": "The `required` keyword specifies that the field or link must have a value. For example, every `Movie` must have a `title`, a `director`, and at least one actor in the `actors` link. Similarly, a `Person` must have both a `first_name` and a `last_name`."}, {"human": "What if I wanted to add a default value for a field?", "assistant": "To add a default value for a field, you can use the `default` keyword followed by the value you want to set as the default. However, the snippet provided doesn't include an example of a default value. Would you like me to show you how to add a default value to a field?"}, {"human": "Yes, please. How would I set a default year for the movies?", "assistant": "To set a default year for movies, you would modify the `year` field in the `Movie` type like this: \n```\nmodule default {\n    type Movie {\n        required title: str;\n        # the year of release\n        year: int64 {\n            default := 2000\n        };\n        required director: Person;\n        required multi actors: Person;\n    }\n    ...\n}\n``` \nThis sets the default year of release for a movie to 2000."}]}

Can you show me how to create an index for a User type based on the name property?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can declare an index within the type definition in your schema. Here's an example of how you would create an index for the 'name' property of a 'User' type:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the SDL code snippet for defining an index on the 'name' property of a 'User' type:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n    required name: str;\n    address: str;\n    multi friends: User;\n\n    # define an index for User based on name\n    index on (.name) {\n        annotation title := 'User name index';\n    }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so the index is defined inside the type definition. What does the annotation do?", "assistant": "The annotation in this context is used to provide additional information about the index. It's like a comment or a note that can describe the index or its purpose. In the example, the annotation 'title' is set to 'User name index', which is a descriptive name for the index. Annotations are optional, but they can be helpful for documentation purposes or to provide metadata."}, {"human": "Got it. And how will this index help with my queries?", "assistant": "The index on the 'name' property will help EdgeDB to quickly locate users based on their names when you're querying the database. This can significantly speed up query performance when you're searching for users by name, especially as your dataset grows larger. The database can use the index to efficiently find the relevant records without scanning the entire dataset."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to define a new index in EdgeDB but I'm not sure how to use the SDL syntax for it. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In SDL, you can define a new index for a type by using the `index on` syntax. Here's a basic example:\n```sdl\nindex on (expression);\n```Replace `expression` with the actual expression you want to index. Would you like to see a more concrete example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example with a specific field.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you have a type `User` and you want to create an index on the `email` field. Here's how you would define it:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required email: str;\n  index on (email);\n}\n```This creates an index on the `email` field of the `User` type."}, {"human": "What if I want to index a computed property or a more complex expression?", "assistant": "You can also index computed properties or any valid EdgeQL expression. For example, if you want to index a concatenation of first and last names in a `Person` type, you could do it like this:\n```sdl\ntype Person {\n  first_name: str;\n  last_name: str;\n  index on (first_name ++ ' ' ++ last_name);\n}\n```This index will be on the full name, which is a concatenation of `first_name` and `last_name` with a space in between."}, {"human": "Got it. And what does the 'except' part mean in the index definition?", "assistant": "The `except` clause in an index definition allows you to exclude certain values from the index. For instance, if you want to index the `email` field but exclude all emails from a specific domain, you could write:\n```sdl\ntype User {\n  required email: str;\n  index on (email) except (email like '%@excludeddomain.com');\n}\n```This will create an index on the `email` field but will not include emails ending with `@excludeddomain.com`."}, {"human": "Is there a way to add additional configuration to an index?", "assistant": "The SDL syntax for indexes is quite straightforward and doesn't directly support additional configurations within the index definition itself. However, you can use DDL (Data Definition Language) commands if you need more advanced index options. The SDL is designed to cover the most common cases, and for more complex scenarios, you might need to use DDL or consult the EdgeDB documentation for further capabilities."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to declare links in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can declare links to establish relationships between different types. There are two kinds of links: abstract and concrete. Would you like an example of each?"}, {"human": "Yes, that would be great. What's an abstract link?", "assistant": "An abstract link is a link that is not tied to any particular type. It's like a template that you can use to create concrete links later. Here's an example of how you can declare an abstract link with a title annotation:"}, {"human": "Okay, show me the example.", "assistant": "```sdl\nabstract link friends_base {\n    # declare a specific title for the link\n    annotation title := 'Close contacts';\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how do I use this abstract link in a concrete type?", "assistant": "To use an abstract link in a concrete type, you define a concrete link that inherits from the abstract link. Here's how you can declare a concrete link 'friends' within a 'User' type:"}, {"human": "Please show me the code for that.", "assistant": "```sdl\ntype User {\n    required name: str;\n    address: str;\n    # define a concrete link that inherits from 'friends_base'\n    multi friends extending friends_base -> User;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What does 'multi' mean in this context?", "assistant": "'multi' indicates that the link is a multi-link, which means a single User can have multiple 'friends'. Each 'User' instance can be linked to many other 'User' instances through the 'friends' link."}, {"human": "I see. Thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB, EdgeQL, SDL, or anything else, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how overloading works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, overloading refers to the process of redefining an inherited link in a subtype by adding more constraints or changing the target type. When you do this, you must use the `overloaded` keyword in your SDL (Schema Definition Language) declaration. This is important to prevent unintentional overloading that might occur due to name clashes. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of how to use the `overloaded` keyword.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say we have an abstract type called `Friendly` that can have 'friends'. Here's how you might define it in SDL:\n```sdl\nabstract type Friendly {\n    multi friends: Person;\n}\n```\nNow, if we want to create a subtype that inherits from `Friendly` but we want to change the definition of 'friends' to be more specific, we use the `overloaded` keyword. Here's an example:\n```sdl\ntype User extending Friendly {\n    overloaded multi friends: User;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `User` type is overloading the 'friends' link to specifically reference other `User` instances, rather than any `Person` instances."}, {"human": "I see, so the `overloaded` keyword is like a flag to indicate that I'm intentionally redefining an inherited link?", "assistant": "Exactly! It's a way to signal to the schema that you're aware of the existing link and you're intentionally making a change to its definition. This helps maintain clarity in the schema and prevents accidental overloading."}, {"human": "What happens if I forget to use the `overloaded` keyword when I'm supposed to?", "assistant": "If you forget to use the `overloaded` keyword when overloading an inherited link, EdgeDB will raise an error when you try to apply the schema. This error acts as a safeguard to ensure that you don't unintentionally overload a link due to a name clash."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the explanation! I'll make sure to use `overloaded` when I'm modifying inherited links.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance with the schema, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to declare modules in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! Declaring a module in EdgeDB is quite straightforward. If you want to declare an empty module, you can do it like this: ```sdl module my_module {} ```"}, {"human": "Got it, and what if I want to add some types or content to the module?", "assistant": "To add content to a module, such as a type, you can include it within the curly braces. Here's an example where we add a `User` type with a required `name` field of type `str`: ```sdl module my_module { type User { required name: str; } } ```"}, {"human": "That looks simple enough. And how do I use this module in my queries?", "assistant": "Once you've declared your module and types, you can use them in your queries by prefixing the type with the module name. For example, if you want to select all users, you would write: ```edgeql SELECT my_module::User; ```"}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to define modules in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, a module is a way to group related database objects together. You can define a module using the SDL (Schema Definition Language) with the following syntax: ```sdl module <module_name> {   # Your definitions go here } ```"}, {"human": "Got it. So if I wanted to create a module for my movie database, I would just use the 'module' keyword followed by the name and curly braces?", "assistant": "Exactly! Here's how you could define a module named 'movies': ```sdl module movies {   # Definitions for movie-related types and functions go here } ```"}, {"human": "What if I want to define a nested module inside the 'movies' module? Is that possible?", "assistant": "Yes, you can define nested modules. The syntax for a nested module is similar, but it's placed inside the outer module's curly braces. Here's an example: ```sdl module movies {   # Definitions for the 'movies' module   module genres {     # Definitions for the 'genres' nested module   } } ```"}, {"human": "That's clear, thanks! So I can basically structure my database schema using modules and nested modules to keep things organized.", "assistant": "Precisely! Modules and nested modules are a great way to organize your schema into logical groups, making it easier to manage and understand."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to define a new module in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can define a new module using the module block declaration in SDL (Schema Definition Language). It's similar to the `create module` command in DDL (Data Definition Language), but it also allows you to include the module's content as nested declarations."}, {"human": "Nested declarations? What does that mean?", "assistant": "Nested declarations mean that within the module block, you can define all the schema items that belong to this module, such as types, functions, and indexes. This way, you can organize all related schema items within the same module block."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use a module block?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example of a module block that defines a module named 'movie' and includes a type declaration for 'Movie':\n```\nmodule movie {\n  type Movie {\n    required title: str;\n    release_year: int16;\n    multi directors: Person;\n  }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to add more types to the 'movie' module later?", "assistant": "You can have multiple module blocks with the same name in an SDL document. Each block can add more schema items to the module. For example, if you want to add an 'Actor' type later, you can do it like this:\n```\nmodule movie {\n  type Actor {\n    required name: str;\n    birth_year: int16;\n  }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "So, I can split the definitions across different blocks, and they will all be part of the same module?", "assistant": "Exactly!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to automatically set timestamps for when a user is created and modified in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use mutation rewrites to automatically set properties like `created` and `modified` timestamps. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you can define a `User` type in SDL with automatic `created` and `modified` properties:\n```\nsdl\ntype User {\n  created: datetime {\n    rewrite insert using (datetime_of_statement());\n  }\n  modified: datetime {\n    rewrite update using (datetime_of_statement());\n  }\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What does `datetime_of_statement()` do?", "assistant": "`datetime_of_statement()` is a function in EdgeDB that returns the current transaction's date and time. When you use it in a `rewrite insert` or `rewrite update`, it sets the `created` or `modified` property to the date and time when the insert or update mutation is executed."}, {"human": "So, does this mean every time I insert a new user, the `created` field will be set to the current time?", "assistant": "Exactly! When you insert a new `User` object, the `created` property will automatically be set to the current date and time of the transaction. Similarly, every time you update a `User` object, the `modified` property will be updated to the transaction's current date and time."}, {"human": "That's really useful.

Can you tell me more about the alternative way to define the same `User` type using abstract?", "assistant": "The documentation snippet you provided mentions an alternative way to define the `User` type using abstract, but it seems to be incomplete. However, I can tell you that in EdgeDB, you can use abstract types to define common properties and links that can be inherited by other types.

Can you show me how to use an abstract type in this context?", "assistant": "Sure, although the documentation snippet doesn't provide the full details, I can give you a general idea. Let's say you have common properties that you want to share across multiple user types. You could define an abstract type like this:\n```sdl\nabstract type Named {\n    required name: str;\n}\n```\nThen, you can inherit from this abstract type in your `User` type:\n```sdl\ntype User extending Named {\n    address: str;\n    multi friends: User;\n    index on (__subject__->name);\n}\n```In this example, `User` inherits the `name` property from the `Named` abstract type, so you don't have to define it again in the `User` type."}]}

Would you like to see the basic syntax for defining a trigger?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me the basic syntax.", "assistant": "Sure, here's the basic syntax for defining a trigger in SDL: \n```\nsdl\ntype TypeName {\n  trigger trigger_name\n    after insert [, ...] # events like insert, update, delete\n    for each # or 'all'\n    [when (condition_expression)]\n    do (action_expression)\n}\n``` \nIn this syntax, you replace 'TypeName' with the name of the type you're defining the trigger for, 'trigger_name' with the name you want to give to the trigger, specify the event(s) that will fire the trigger, and define a condition and action if needed."}, {"human": "What does 'each' and 'all' mean in this context?", "assistant": "'each' and 'all' refer to the level at which the trigger operates. If you use 'each', the trigger will be fired once for every row that is affected by the event. On the other hand, if you use 'all', the trigger will be fired just once for the entire operation, regardless of how many rows are affected."}, {"human": "I see. Can you give me an example of a trigger that runs after an insert operation?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's an example of a trigger that runs after a new record is inserted into a type called 'User': \n```\nsdl\ntype User {\n  trigger log_insert\n    after insert\n    for each\n    do (INSERT INTO Log { event_type := 'insert', description := 'New user record inserted.' })\n}\n``` \nThis trigger is named 'log_insert' and it will insert a new log entry into a 'Log' type every time a new 'User' record is inserted."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And what about the 'when' clause?", "assistant": "The 'when' clause is used to specify a condition that must be true for the trigger to fire. For example, if you only want to log inserts for users with a specific email domain, you could write: \n```\nsdl\ntype User {\n  trigger log_insert\n    after insert\n    for each\n    when (new.email LIKE '%@example.com')\n    do (INSERT INTO Log { event_type := 'insert', description := 'New example.com user record inserted.' })\n}\n``` \nIn this case, the trigger will only execute its action if the new user's email ends with '@example.com'."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I came across the term 'anyreal' in EdgeDB. What does it mean?", "assistant": "The term 'anyreal' in EdgeDB refers to an abstract base scalar type. It's a type that encompasses `anyint`, `anyfloat`, and `decimal` types. It's not a type that you would use directly in your schema, but it's useful for functions and operators that can operate on any kind of real number."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how 'anyreal' might be used?", "assistant": "Certainly! While you can't directly create a property of type 'anyreal', you can use it in a function that accepts any kind of real number. For example, if you wanted to create a function that calculates the square of a number, you could define it to accept 'anyreal' so it can take any integer, float, or decimal number:\n```eql\nfunction square(number: anyreal) -> anyreal\nusing (number * number);\n```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So it's more about polymorphism in functions?", "assistant": "Exactly! It allows functions and operators to be more flexible by accepting a range of numeric types. This way, you don't need to write multiple versions of the same function for different numeric types."}]}

It's an abstract type, which means it's more like a template or a concept that other, more concrete types are based on. You would use the specific scalar types like `int64` or `datetime` in your models."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me an example of how I might define a range type using one of these scalar types?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you want to define a range of `int32` values to represent the valid scores in a game. You could define a custom scalar type like this in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype ScoreRange extending std::range<int32>;\n``\nThis creates a new type called `ScoreRange` that is a range of `int32` values."}, {"human": "And how would I use this `ScoreRange` in a type definition?", "assistant": "You can use `ScoreRange` as a property type in your object types. For example:\n``sdl\ntype Game {\n  required name: str;\n  score_range: ScoreRange;\n}\n``\nIn this `Game` type, we have a `name` property that's required and a `score_range` property that uses the `ScoreRange` type we defined earlier."}, {"human": "That makes sense.

Let's say you're creating a type for events in your database. You might want to use `cal::local_date` to store the date of the event. Here's how you could define it in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype Event {\n  required date: cal::local_date;\n  # ... other properties and links ...\n}\n``"}, {"human": "I see, and if I wanted to create a range of dates, how would I do that?", "assistant": "To create a range of dates, you would use the `range` type in combination with `cal::local_date`. Here's an example:\n``sdl\ntype Event {\n  date_range: range<cal::local_date>;\n  # ... other properties and links ...\n}\n``\nThis would allow you to store a start and end date for an event."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

In EdgeDB, 'anycontiguous' is an abstract base type that is used for all valid contiguous ranges. It's a scalar type that serves as a base for other types like `float32`, `float64`, `decimal`, `datetime`, and `cal::local_datetime`. These types represent continuous values, so they can form ranges where each value has a direct successor or predecessor."}, {"human": "So, is 'anycontiguous' a type I can use directly in my schema?", "assistant": "No, 'anycontiguous' itself is an abstract type, which means you cannot use it directly to define a property in your schema.

Can you show me an example of how I might define a range in my schema using one of these types?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you want to define a type for an event that has a start and end time. You could use `datetime` for this. Here's how you might define it in SDL:\n```sdl\ntype Event {\n  required start_time: datetime;\n  required end_time: datetime;\n}\n```In this example, both `start_time` and `end_time` are properties of the `Event` type that use the `datetime` scalar type, which is a subtype of 'anycontiguous'."}, {"human": "That makes sense.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what 'anytype' means in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `anytype` is a generic type that acts as a placeholder. It's used in situations where you don't need to specify a particular type. For example, you might use it when defining polymorphic parameters in functions and operators, where the function can accept arguments of any type."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how 'anytype' is used in a function?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you want to create a function that can accept any type of input and simply return the same value. Here's how you might define it using `anytype`:\n```eql\nfunction identity(input: anytype) -> anytype\n{\n    using (SELECT input);\n}\n```This `identity` function takes a parameter `input` of type `anytype` and returns a value of the same type. You can pass an integer, string, or any other type to this function, and it will return the value unchanged."}, {"human": "Oh, I see. Is 'anytype' used often in EdgeDB schemas?", "assistant": "It's not commonly used in schema definitions themselves, as you usually want to define specific types for your data. However, `anytype` is quite useful when you're creating generic functions or operators that are meant to work with multiple types of data without being restricted to one specific type."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand what 'anyobject' means in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `anyobject` is a special type that represents a generic object. It's similar to `anytype`, which is used for denoting a generic type. You can use `anyobject` when you want to define polymorphic parameters in functions and operators. This means that `anyobject` will conform to whatever object type is actually passed to the function or operator."}, {"human": "So is `anyobject` the same as `BaseObject`?", "assistant": "No, `anyobject` is different from `BaseObject`. While `BaseObject` is indeed the parent type of all object types in EdgeDB, `anyobject` is used specifically for polymorphism. When you use `anyobject`, you're not referring to a specific type hierarchy but rather to any object type that might be passed to a function or operator."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how `anyobject` might be used?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you're creating a function that can accept any kind of object and perform an operation on it.

So when I call this function, I can pass any object type I have in my database?", "assistant": "Exactly! You can pass any object type defined in your database to this function, and it will work just fine.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what 'anyscalar' means in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `anyscalar` is an abstract base scalar type. This means that all scalar types, like integers, strings, or booleans, are derived from this type. It's a way to refer to any scalar value without specifying the exact type."}, {"human": "So, can I use 'anyscalar' directly in my schema?", "assistant": "No, you can't use `anyscalar` directly in your schema to define a property because it's an abstract type. Instead, you should use specific scalar types like `str` for strings, `int64` for integers, and so on, depending on the kind of data you want to store."}, {"human": "Got it! Can you show me a quick example of how I would define a scalar property in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example of a type definition in SDL with a scalar property:\n```\nsdl\ntype Person {\n  name: str;\n  age: int16;\n}\n```In this example, `name` is a scalar property of type `str`, and `age` is a scalar property of type `int16`."}]}

It's a way to group all enums under a single type umbrella."}, {"human": "So how would I define my own enum type in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Defining your own enum type is straightforward. Here's a simple example using SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n\n```sdl\ntype Status {\n    required status: enum<Open, Closed, Pending>;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've defined an enum type with three possible values: 'Open', 'Closed', and 'Pending'. This enum is then used as the type for the 'status' field in the 'Status' type."}, {"human": "I see. And how can I use this enum in a query?", "assistant": "You can use the enum in a query just like any other field. For example, if you want to select all items with a status of 'Open', you could write an EdgeQL query like this:\n\n```eql\nSELECT Status\nFILTER Status.status = <Status.status>'Open';\n```\n\nThis query filters the 'Status' type instances where the 'status' field is equal to the 'Open' value of the enum."}, {"human": "Got it. And can I use 'anyenum' directly in my queries or schema?", "assistant": "No, you cannot use 'anyenum' directly since it's an abstract type.

Here's how you might define that function using `anytuple`:\n```eql\nfunction tuple_to_string(input: anytuple) -> str\n{\n    using (SELECT <str>input);\n}\n```\nIn this example, the function `tuple_to_string` takes a parameter `input` of type `anytuple` and returns a string. The function body uses a simple SELECT expression to cast the tuple to a string. This function will now accept any tuple, regardless of the types or number of elements it contains. Does that help clarify how `anytuple` is used?"}, {"human": "Yes, that makes sense. So, I can pass any tuple to this function, and it will work?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `anytuple` type allows the function to accept any tuple, no matter what the specific structure or types of the elements are. This makes your function very flexible and able to handle a wide range of inputs. Just keep in mind that since `anytuple` is very generic, you won't have information about the structure of the tuple inside the function, which might limit what you can do with it in some cases."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the explanation and example!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what 'anyint' means in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `anyint` is an abstract base scalar type that encompasses the integer types `int16`, `int32`, and `int64`. It's not a type that you would use directly in your schema to store values, but rather a way to refer to any of those specific integer types in a more generic way."}, {"human": "So, how would I use `anyint` in practice?", "assistant": "You would typically use `anyint` when you're writing functions or abstracting logic that can operate on any integer type. For example, if you're creating a function that adds two numbers and you want it to work with `int16`, `int32`, and `int64`, you could specify the function's arguments as `anyint`. However, for storing actual data in your schema, you would choose a specific integer type like `int16`, `int32`, or `int64` based on the range of values you need to store."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of a function using `anyint`?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example of a function in EdgeQL that takes two `anyint` arguments and returns their sum, which is also an `anyint`:\n```eql\nfunction add_integers(a: anyint, b: anyint) -> anyint\nusing (\n    SELECT a + b\n)\n```This function can add integers of different sizes, as long as they are `int16`, `int32`, or `int64`."}, {"human": "Got it! And if I wanted to create a property that can store any integer size, how would I do that?", "assistant": "In your schema, you would still need to choose a specific integer type for the property based on the expected range of values. For example, if you expect the values to be within the range of a 32-bit integer, you would define the property using `int32` like this:\n```sdl\ntype Example {\n    property example_int: int32;\n}\n```Remember, `anyint` is not used for defining properties in a schema; it's used in situations where you want to write more generic code that applies to all integer types."}]}

Can you show me an example of how to use 'anyfloat' in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example where we define a type `Measurement` with a property `value` that can accept any kind of floating-point number, whether it's `float32` or `float64`:\n```sdl\ntype Measurement {\n  value: anyfloat;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "And how would I insert data into this 'Measurement' type?", "assistant": "To insert data into the `Measurement` type, you would use an EdgeQL INSERT command.

So the elements inside the array need to be of the same type, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! All elements within the array must be of the same type. If you're creating an array of tuples, each tuple must have the same structure and data types for each element."}, {"human": "What happens if I mix different types in an array?", "assistant": "If you try to mix different types in an array, EdgeDB will raise a type error.

The `array_unpack()` function in EdgeDB is used to return the elements of an array as a set. When you have an array and you want to process its elements individually, you can use this function to 'unpack' the array into a set of its elements."}, {"human": "I see. Could you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have an array of integers `[2, 3, 5, 7]` and you want to unpack it.

However, if you need to maintain the order, you can wrap the `array_unpack()` call in a call to `enumerate()`. This will assign indexes to the elements that match their order in the original array. Here's how you can do it:\n```edgeql\nselect enumerate(array_unpack([2, 3, 5, 7]));\n```\nThis will return a set of tuples, where each tuple contains an index and an element from the array, preserving the original order."}, {"human": "Got it. Is there anything else I should know about using array_unpack()?", "assistant": "Just remember that `array_unpack()` works with arrays and returns a set of elements. Since sets in EdgeDB do not have a guaranteed order, if you need to work with ordered data, using `enumerate()` in conjunction with `array_unpack()` is the way to go.

For example, if you have an array [1, 2, 3], you can access the first element with [1, 2, 3][0]."}, {"human": "So the indexing starts at 0, just like in Python?", "assistant": "Exactly, indexing starts at 0. So for the array [1, 2, 3], the index 0 corresponds to the first element, which is 1."}, {"human": "What if I want to access the second element?", "assistant": "To access the second element, you would use index 1. Here's how you can do it: `select [1, 2, 3][1];` This will return {2}."}, {"human": "Got it. And how can I access the last element of the array?", "assistant": "You can access elements from the end of the array using a negative index. For example, to get the last element of the array [1, 2, 3], you can use: `select [1, 2, 3][-1];` This will return {3}."}, {"human": "What if the array contains tuples, not just simple numbers?", "assistant": "You can still use the same indexing method. For example, if you have an array of tuples like [(x := 1, y := 1), (x := 2, y := 3.3)], you can access the second tuple with: `select [(x := 1, y := 1), (x := 2, y := 3.3)][1];` This will return {(x := 2, y := 3.3)}."}, {"human": "This is really helpful, thanks! Can I also modify elements in the array?", "assistant": "In EdgeDB, arrays are immutable, so you cannot modify an element directly in an array. If you need to change an element, you would typically create a new array with the desired modifications."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to work with arrays in EdgeDB. Can you explain how slicing works?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, you can create a sub-array from an existing array using the slice operator, which is denoted by square brackets `[from:to]`. This operator allows you to specify a range within the array to extract. For example, `array[1:3]` would give you a sub-array starting from index 1 up to, but not including, index 3."}, {"human": "What happens if I don't specify the start or end index?", "assistant": "If you omit the lower bound of the slice, it defaults to zero, which means the slice will start from the beginning of the array. If you omit the upper bound, the slice will include all elements from the lower bound to the end of the array. Remember, the lower bound is inclusive, but the upper bound is exclusive."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use this in a query?", "assistant": "Certainly! Let's say you have an array of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and you want to get a sub-array from the second element to the fourth element. You would write a query like this:\n```eql\nSELECT array[1:4];\n```\nThis query would return `[2, 3, 4]` as the result."}, {"human": "What if I want to include everything from the third element to the end?", "assistant": "In that case, you would omit the upper bound in the slice. Here's how you would write the query:\n```eql\nSELECT array[2:];\n```\nAssuming your array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, this would return `[3, 4, 5]`."}, {"human": "And if I want just the first two elements?", "assistant": "To get just the first two elements, you would set the upper bound to 2, like this:\n```eql\nSELECT array[:2];\n```\nThis would return `[1, 2]` from the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to combine two lists in EdgeDB. Is there an easy way to do that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can concatenate two arrays using the '++' operator. Both arrays need to be of the same type. Here's how you can do it:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Sure! If you have two arrays, say `[1, 2, 3]` and `[99, 98]`, you can concatenate them like this in EdgeQL:\n```edgeql\nselect [1, 2, 3] ++ [99, 98];\n```\nThe result will be a single array: `{[1, 2, 3, 99, 98]}`."}, {"human": "What if the arrays have different types?", "assistant": "The '++' operator requires that both arrays have the same type. If you try to concatenate arrays of different types, you'll get a type error. Make sure the elements of both arrays are of the same type before concatenating them."}, {"human": "Got it. And can I use this in any EdgeQL query?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use the array concatenation operator '++' in any EdgeQL query where you need to combine arrays of the same type. It's a standard operator in EdgeQL."}, {"human": "Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or EdgeQL, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the array_agg() function in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The array_agg() function in EdgeDB is used to create an array from a set of elements. When you apply array_agg() to a set, it combines all the elements of that set into an array. If the set has an order specified, the resulting array will preserve that order."}, {"human": "I see. Could you show me an example of how to use it without any ordering?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example where we use array_agg() to create an array from a set of integers without any specific ordering:\n```edgeql\nselect array_agg({2, 3, 5});\n```\nThe result of this query would be:\n```\n{[2, 3, 5]}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And how would I use it with ordering?", "assistant": "To use array_agg() with ordering, you would specify the order using the 'order by' clause. Here's an example where we create an array of user names ordered alphabetically:\n```edgeql\nselect array_agg(User.name order by User.name);\n```\nThe result would be an array of user names sorted alphabetically, like this:\n```\n{['Alice', 'Bob', 'Joe', 'Sam']}\n```"}, {"human": "That makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about using array_agg()?", "assistant": "Just remember that array_agg() works on a set of elements, so the input should be a set. Also, if you're working with a multi-property or a link, you'll already have a set to work with. Otherwise, you might need to construct a set using curly braces `{}` or by querying for a set of elements from the database."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to retrieve an element from an array in EdgeDB but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `array_get()` function to retrieve an element from an array at a specific index. Here's the syntax for the function:\n```eql\nstd::array_get(array: array, index: int64, default: anytype = {}) -> optional anytype\n```\nThis function will return the element at the given index. If the index is out of bounds, it will return the `default` value you provide, or an empty set if no default is specified."}, {"human": "I see. Could you show me an example of how to use `array_get()` in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have an array of integers `[1, 2, 3]` and you want to get the element at index 1. Here's how you would write the query:\n```eql\nSELECT std::array_get(array => [1, 2, 3], index => 1);\n```\nThis will return `2`, since arrays are zero-indexed and the element at index 1 is the second element."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to access an index that doesn't exist, like index 5 in the array you mentioned?", "assistant": "If you try to access an index that's out of bounds, `array_get()` will return the default value. If you haven't specified a default, it will return an empty set. Here's an example with the same array, trying to access index 5:\n```eql\nSELECT std::array_get(array => [1, 2, 3], index => 5);\n```\nSince index 5 is out of bounds, this query will return `{}` (an empty set)."}, {"human": "Can I specify my own default value for cases when the index is out of bounds?", "assistant": "Yes, you can specify a default value that `array_get()` should return when the index is out of bounds. For example, if you want to return `-1` as the default value, you would write the query like this:\n```eql\nSELECT std::array_get(array => [1, 2, 3], index => 5, default => -1);\n```\nWith this query, since index 5 is out of bounds, it will return `-1` instead of an empty set."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how boolean logic works in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, boolean logic operates similarly to other programming languages. You have the `bool` type, which represents a boolean value, and you can use logical operators like `or`, `and`, and `not` to combine or negate boolean values. Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some examples of how to use these operators.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's how you can use the `or` and `and` operators in EdgeQL, EdgeDB's query language:\n\n```\nSELECT (\n    (true or false),  # This will evaluate to true\n    (true and false), # This will evaluate to false\n    (not false)       # This will evaluate to true\n);\n```\n\nThese expressions use the boolean literals `true` and `false`, but you can also use them with boolean expressions or fields from your database."}, {"human": "What about comparison operators? How do they work with booleans?", "assistant": "Comparison operators like `=`, `!=`, `?=`, and `?!=` can be used to compare boolean values. Here's an example:\n\n```\nSELECT (\n    (true = true),   # This will evaluate to true\n    (true != false),  # This will evaluate to true\n    (true ?= null),   # This will evaluate to false\n    (false ?!= null)  # This will evaluate to true\n);\n```\n\nThe `?=` operator checks if the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side or if both are `null`. The `?!=` operator is the opposite; it's true if the left-hand side is not equal to the right-hand side, or if one side is `null`."}, {"human": "I see. And what is the `all()` function about?", "assistant": "The `all()` function is used in aggregate queries. It returns `true` if none of the values in a given set are `false` or `null`. If at least one value is `false` or `null`, it returns `false`. Here's how you might use it:\n\n```\nSELECT all(array_agg(User.active));\n```\n\nIn this example, if all `User` entries have the `active` field set to `true`, the query will return `true`. If any `User` has `active` set to `false` or `null`, it will return `false`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand the boolean type in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, the boolean type is represented by `bool`. It can have a value of either `true` or `false`. And don't worry about case sensitivity; the boolean literals are case-insensitive."}, {"human": "Case-insensitive? So I can write 'TRUE' or 'true' interchangeably?", "assistant": "Exactly! Whether you write 'True', 'true', or 'TRUE', EdgeDB treats them all as the same boolean value `true`. The same goes for `false` as well. Would you like to see an example of how this works in an EdgeQL query?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's an example where we select boolean literals in different cases: \n```edgeql-repl\ndb> select (True, true, TRUE);\n{(true, true, true)}\ndb> select (False, false, FALSE);\n{(false, false, false)}\n``` \nAs you can see, regardless of how you case the literals, the output is the same."}, {"human": "Got it! And what kind of basic operators result in a boolean type value?", "assistant": "In EdgeQL, basic operators like logical AND, OR, NOT, comparison operators like '=', '!=', '<', '>', '<=', and '>=', and other operators that imply a true or false condition will result in a boolean type value. For example, `select 1 > 0;` will return `true` because the condition 1 being greater than 0 is true."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or EdgeQL, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about how the 'or' operator works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the 'or' operator is used to perform a logical disjunction between two boolean values. It evaluates to `true` if at least one of the operands is `true`. Here's a simple example: ```edgeql-repl db> select false or true; {true} ```"}, {"human": "What happens if one of the operands is an empty set?", "assistant": "That's a good question. When either operand in an `or` expression is an empty set, the result is not a `bool` but an empty set instead. For example: ```edgeql-repl db> select true or {}; > {} ``` This behavior is important to keep in mind because it can affect the outcome of your queries."}, {"human": "So, if I understand correctly, using 'or' with an empty set won't give me a boolean value?", "assistant": "Exactly. If one of the operands is an empty set, the result of the 'or' operation will also be an empty set. This is different from some other programming languages where the result would still be a boolean."}, {"human": "Thanks for clarifying that! Can you show me another example where 'or' is used with non-empty sets?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's an example where both operands are non-empty boolean values: ```edgeql-repl db> select true or false; {true} ``` And here's an example where one operand is `true` and the other is `false`, but neither is an empty set: ```edgeql-repl db> select false or false; {false} ``` As you can see, the result is a boolean value as expected when both operands are actual boolean values."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the 'and' operator works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the 'and' operator is used to evaluate logical conjunctions. It takes two boolean values and returns `true` if both operands are `true`. If one or both operands are `false`, the result will be `false`. Here's the syntax: `bool and bool -> bool`."}, {"human": "Could you give me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example where we use the 'and' operator with a `true` and a `false` value: ```edgeql-repl db> select false and true; {false} ``` As you can see, since one of the operands is `false`, the result is `false`."}, {"human": "What happens if one of the operands is an empty set?", "assistant": "That's a good question. When either operand in an `and` operation is an empty set, the result will not be a `bool` but instead an empty set. Here's an example: ```edgeql-repl db> select true and {}; > {} ``` So, if you're expecting a boolean result, you need to ensure that neither operand is an empty set."}, {"human": "I see, so the presence of an empty set in an 'and' operation changes the result type. Is there anything else I should be aware of?", "assistant": "You've got the main idea. Just remember that the 'and' operator is strictly for boolean values, and the presence of an empty set can lead to results that might not be immediately intuitive. Always check for empty sets when you're working with logical operators to avoid unexpected results."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the 'not' operator works in EdgeQL. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeQL, the 'not' operator is used to logically negate a boolean value. If you have a boolean value and you want to get the opposite value, you use 'not'. For example, if you have 'true' and you apply 'not', it will return 'false', and vice versa. Here's a simple example: ```edgeql-repl db> select not false; {true} ```"}, {"human": "Okay, that makes sense. But what happens if I use 'not' on something that's not a boolean value?", "assistant": "The 'not' operator is specifically meant for boolean values. If you try to use it on a non-boolean, you'll get an error. However, there's an interesting case when you use 'not' on an empty set. In EdgeDB, an empty set is considered to be of an indeterminate type, so when you apply 'not' to an empty set, the result is also an empty set, not a boolean value. Here's an example: ```edgeql-repl > db> select not {}; > {} > ```"}, {"human": "That's a bit confusing. So you're saying 'not' on an empty set doesn't return 'true' or 'false'?", "assistant": "Exactly. When you apply 'not' to an empty set, the result is an empty set. This is because the empty set doesn't have a value to negate, so the operation doesn't return a boolean value at all. It's important to keep this in mind when working with boolean logic in EdgeDB to avoid unexpected results."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the clarification! I'll make sure to check for empty sets when using 'not'.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeQL or any other aspect of EdgeDB, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the assert function in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The `assert` function in EdgeDB is used to check that a given boolean expression evaluates to `true`. If the expression is `true`, the function returns `true`. However, if the expression is `false`, the function raises a `QueryAssertionError`. You can also provide an optional message that will be included in the error if the assertion fails."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example where we assert that the value `true` is indeed true:\n```edgeql\nSELECT assert(true);\n```\nThis will return `{true}` because the assertion passes. Now, if we assert something that's false, like this:\n```edgeql\nSELECT assert(false);\n```\nThis will raise an error because the assertion fails."}, {"human": "What if I want to include a custom message with the assertion?", "assistant": "You can include a custom message by using the `message` named argument. For example:\n```edgeql\nSELECT assert(false, message := 'This should not happen!');\n```\nIf the assertion fails, it will raise a `QueryAssertionError` with the message 'This should not happen!'."}, {"human": "Is the message argument required?", "assistant": "No, the message argument is optional. If you don't provide it, the `assert` function will still raise an error for a failed assertion, but the error message will be a default one provided by EdgeDB."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to work with raw data in EdgeDB. Can you explain the bytes type to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the `bytes` type is used to represent a sequence of bytes, which is essentially raw binary data. You can use this type when you need to store data that doesn't fit traditional data types like integers or strings."}, {"human": "How do I create a bytes literal in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "To create a bytes literal, you use the syntax `b''`. Inside the single quotes, you can place your raw data. For example, to represent the text 'Hello, world' as bytes, you would write `b'Hello, world'`."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use bytes in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example where we select a bytes literal using EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nselect b'Hello, world';\n```\nWhen you run this query, the output will be: `{b'Hello, world'}`."}, {"human": "What if I have some special characters or binary data that I want to include?", "assistant": "For special characters or binary data, you can use escape sequences in your bytes literals. For example, the escape sequence for a space character is `\\x20`. Here's how you can include a space and a binary character with the code 01 in your bytes literal: \n```edgeql\nselect b'Hello,\\x20world\\x01';\n```\nThe output of this query will be: `{b'Hello, world\\x01'}`."}, {"human": "Are there any functions in EdgeDB that work with bytes?", "assistant": "Yes, EdgeDB provides some generic functions that can operate on bytes. However, the documentation snippet you provided doesn't specify which functions are available. Typically, you might find functions for converting bytes to other types, or for manipulating the bytes data, such as finding its length or extracting subsets of the data."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to access a specific byte in a binary data type in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can access a byte at a specific index within a binary data type using the `bytes[i]` operator. The index `i` is an `int64` representing the position of the byte you want to access."}, {"human": "Could you show me an example of how to use this operator?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a binary string `b'binary \\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04 ftw!'` and you want to access the byte at index 2. You would use the following EdgeQL query:\n```edgeql\nselect b'binary \\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04 ftw!'[2];\n```\nThis query would return `{b'n'}`, which is the byte at the second index of the binary string."}, {"human": "What if I wanted to access the byte at index 8?", "assistant": "To access the byte at index 8, you would use a similar query:\n```edgeql\nselect b'binary \\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04 ftw!'[8];\n```\nThis would return `{b'\\x02'}`, since `\\x02` is the byte at the eighth index."}, {"human": "Is there anything else I should know when using this operator?", "assistant": "Just remember that the index is zero-based, so the first byte is at index 0.

Is this operation only for bytes or can it be used with other types as well?", "assistant": "The '++' operator is specifically for concatenating bytes in EdgeDB. If you want to concatenate strings, you would use the '++' operator as well, but the syntax is slightly different since you're dealing with string values.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the bytes_get_bit function in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! The `bytes_get_bit` function in EdgeDB is used to retrieve a specific bit from a `bytes` value. You provide the `bytes` value and the position of the bit you want to check, called `nth`, and the function returns the value of that bit as an `int64`. The bits are enumerated from the least significant to the most significant within each byte."}, {"human": "I see. Could you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure!

And how can I use this function within a larger query, say, if I want to encode some data that's stored in a property of a type?", "assistant": "You can use the `enc::base64_encode()` function in a larger query by selecting the property you want to encode. For example, if you have a type `File` with a `data` property of type `bytes`, you can encode this property like so:\n```edgeql\nselect File {\n  base64_data := enc::base64_encode(.data)\n};\n```\nThis will return a set of `File` objects with an additional computed property `base64_data` that contains the Base64-encoded string of the `data` property."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! Just to clarify, this function only works with `bytes` type, right?", "assistant": "Yes, that's correct. The `enc::base64_encode()` function is specifically designed to take a `bytes` type as input and return a Base64-encoded `str`. If you try to pass a value of a different type, you'll get an error."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to decode a Base64 string in EdgeDB. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `enc::base64_decode()` function to decode a Base64-encoded string. Here's how you can use it:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Sure! If you have a Base64-encoded string like 'aGVsbG8=', you can decode it to bytes using the following EdgeQL query:\n```edgeql\nselect enc::base64_decode('aGVsbG8=');\n```\nThis will return the bytes representation of the original string, which in this case is `b'hello'`."}, {"human": "What happens if the Base64 string is not valid?", "assistant": "If the input string is not a valid Base64-encoded string, the `enc::base64_decode()` function will raise an `InvalidValueError`. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect enc::base64_decode('aGVsbG8');\n```\nThis will result in an error because 'aGVsbG8' is not a valid Base64 string."}, {"human": "I see. Is there anything else I should know about using this function?", "assistant": "Just remember that the function expects a string as input and returns the decoded data as bytes. If you're handling text, you might need to convert the bytes to a string using additional functions, depending on your use case. Otherwise, you're all set to use `enc::base64_decode()` in your EdgeDB queries!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand what an AuthMethod is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `cfg::AuthMethod` is an abstract object class that represents a method of authentication. It's not something you would use directly, but rather, it serves as a base for more specific types of authentication methods."}, {"human": "What are the specific authentication methods available?", "assistant": "There are four concrete subclasses of `cfg::AuthMethod` that represent the available authentication methods in EdgeDB. These are `cfg::SCRAM`, `cfg::JWT`, `cfg::Password`, and `cfg::Trust`. Each of these subclasses corresponds to a different way of handling authentication."}, {"human": "Can you show me how this is represented in EdgeDB's schema?", "assistant": "Sure! While I can't show you the internal definitions of these types, I can explain how you might reference them. For example, if you have a configuration type that needs to specify what authentication methods it supports, you might have a property like this:\n```sdl\ntype MyConfig {\n  transports: multi cfg::ConnectionTransport;\n}\n```\nIn this snippet, `transports` is a multi-link to `cfg::ConnectionTransport`, which would be related to the authentication methods."}, {"human": "What does the 'multi' keyword mean in this context?", "assistant": "The `multi` keyword indicates that the link can reference multiple instances of the specified type. So in the case of `transports: multi cfg::ConnectionTransport;`, it means that `MyConfig` can be associated with multiple `cfg::ConnectionTransport` instances, allowing for various transport configurations."}, {"human": "Is there a way to define a custom authentication method?", "assistant": "Custom authentication methods are not typically defined in EdgeDB schema. You would usually choose from the predefined authentication methods (`cfg::SCRAM`, `cfg::JWT`, `cfg::Password`, and `cfg::Trust`). These methods cover a wide range of authentication scenarios. If you need a custom solution, it would likely involve external authentication mechanisms that interface with EdgeDB."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what the 'cfg::Trust' type is used for in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'cfg::Trust' type in EdgeDB is used to indicate an 'always-trust' policy. When you configure an authentication method with 'cfg::Trust', it means that the system will not require password-based authentication for connections. It's a way to disable password checks for certain connections, which might be useful in trusted environments."}, {"human": "Interesting, how would I go about setting this up?", "assistant": "To set up an 'always-trust' policy using 'cfg::Trust', you would use the EdgeQL command to configure the instance. Here's an example of how you can insert a new authentication method with 'cfg::Trust':\n```edgeql\nedgedb> configure instance insert Auth {priority := 0, method := (insert Trust)};\nOK: CONFIGURE INSTANCE\n```This command adds a new 'Auth' configuration with the highest priority (0), which uses the 'Trust' method. After running this, the instance will trust all connections without requiring a password."}, {"human": "Does this mean that anyone can connect to my database without a password?", "assistant": "Yes, that's correct. Using 'cfg::Trust' means that no password is required to connect to the database. This should only be used in environments where security is not a concern, or where you have other security measures in place. It's important to be cautious with this setting to avoid unauthorized access to your database."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the warning. I'll make sure to use it carefully.", "assistant": "You're welcome! Always make sure to review your security settings and understand the implications before applying changes like this. If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I've been reading about EdgeDB and came across 'cfg::SCRAM'. Can you tell me what that is?", "assistant": "Certainly! `cfg::SCRAM` refers to a password-based authentication method used in EdgeDB. It stands for Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism, which is a way to securely authenticate users without transmitting the actual password over the network. Instead, it uses a challenge-response scheme."}, {"human": "How is this challenge-response scheme implemented?", "assistant": "The challenge-response scheme in EdgeDB is implemented via `SCRAM-SHA-256`. This means it uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm as part of the authentication process to ensure that passwords are not sent in plain text."}, {"human": "Is `cfg::SCRAM` available for all types of connections?", "assistant": "`cfg::SCRAM` is available for `TCP`, `TCP_PG`, and `HTTP` transports within EdgeDB. It's the default authentication policy for both `TCP` and `TCP_PG` connections."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the explanation! How would I use it in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You don't need to do anything special to use `cfg::SCRAM` as it's the default authentication method for the supported transports. When you set up a user with a password in EdgeDB, `cfg::SCRAM` will be used automatically for the authentication process."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how authentication works with EdgeDB. Can you tell me about cfg::JWT?", "assistant": "Certainly! The `cfg::JWT` type in EdgeDB is used for authentication purposes. It relies on a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed by the server. This method of authentication can be used with different types of transport protocols such as TCP, HTTP, and HTTP_SIMPLE. By default, `cfg::JWT` is the authentication method used for the HTTP transport. Would you like to know how to set it up or have more specific questions?"}, {"human": "Yes, I'd like to know how to set it up for my HTTP service.", "assistant": "To set up JWT authentication for your HTTP service in EdgeDB, you'll need to configure the authentication method using EdgeDB's settings. While I don't have the exact steps in the current documentation excerpt, the process generally involves creating a JWT secret and configuring the EdgeDB server to use this secret to sign the tokens. You would then use these tokens to authenticate HTTP requests to your EdgeDB instance. For detailed instructions, you should refer to the EdgeDB documentation on authentication or the specific section on configuring `cfg::JWT`. Would you like a link to the documentation for more comprehensive guidance?"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm setting up authentication for my EdgeDB project and I came across 'cfg::Password'. Can you explain what that is?", "assistant": "Certainly! The `cfg::Password` type indicates a simple password-based authentication method. When you use this type of authentication, the password is transmitted over an encrypted channel. It's implemented using HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS, which is a widely used protocol for passing credentials in a secure manner."}, {"human": "So, is this `cfg::Password` authentication secure?", "assistant": "Yes, it is secure as long as the channel is encrypted, typically with TLS (Transport Layer Security). This ensures that the password is not exposed in plain text during transmission. However, it's worth noting that there are more secure methods available, such as `cfg::SCRAM`, which provides additional security measures."}, {"human": "I see. And where can I use this `cfg::Password` policy?", "assistant": "The `cfg::Password` policy is available only for the `SIMPLE_HTTP` transport. In fact, it's the default authentication policy for this transport. So, if you're using `SIMPLE_HTTP`, you'll be using `cfg::Password` unless you specify otherwise."}, {"human": "Got it. How would I go about setting this up in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "To set up `cfg::Password` authentication in EdgeDB, you would typically configure your authentication methods in the server settings. Since `cfg::Password` is the default for `SIMPLE_HTTP` transport, you might not need to do much if you're using that transport. However, for a detailed setup, you would refer to the EdgeDB documentation on authentication and follow the steps provided there."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand what cfg::memory is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `cfg::memory` is a scalar type that represents a quantity of memory storage. It's similar to other scalar types like `uuid` or `datetime`, in that you declare `cfg::memory` values by casting from a string that's formatted in a specific way."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use cfg::memory?", "assistant": "Of course! Here are a few examples of how you can select memory sizes using EdgeQL, which is the query language for EdgeDB. You simply cast a string to `cfg::memory` by using the select statement:\n\n```edgeql\nSELECT <cfg::memory>'1B'; # This selects 1 byte\nSELECT <cfg::memory>'5KiB'; # This selects 5 kibibytes\nSELECT <cfg::memory>'128MiB'; # This selects 128 mebibytes\n```"}, {"human": "What happens if I use an incorrect format?", "assistant": "If you use an incorrect format when casting a string to `cfg::memory`, EdgeDB will raise an error indicating that the format is invalid. It's important to use the correct suffixes and format when specifying memory sizes. Valid suffixes include 'B' for bytes, 'KiB' for kibibytes, 'MiB' for mebibytes, and so on."}, {"human": "Is there a way to use cfg::memory in a data model?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use `cfg::memory` in your data model by defining it as a property of a type in your schema. Here's an example using SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n\n```sdl\ntype Server {\n  id: uuid;\n  memory_capacity: cfg::memory;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a `Server` type has a `memory_capacity` property that uses the `cfg::memory` type to represent the server's memory capacity."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what cfg::Config is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `cfg::Config` is an abstract object type that represents the configuration of an EdgeDB instance or a specific database. The properties within this type correspond to the various configuration options that EdgeDB supports."}, {"human": "So, it's like a settings panel but in the form of a database object?", "assistant": "Exactly! You can think of `cfg::Config` as a structured collection of settings that control different aspects of an EdgeDB instance or database. Each property in the `cfg::Config` type is a specific setting you can view or adjust."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how this might look in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure, although `cfg::Config` is a built-in abstract type and you wouldn't normally define it yourself in SDL, I can show you an example of what a configuration type might look like in SDL. Here's a simplified version:\n``sdl\ntype cfg::Config {\n  abstract;\n  # Define various configuration properties\n  session_idle_timeout: duration;\n  query_execution_timeout: duration;\n}\n``\nIn this example, there are two hypothetical configuration options: `session_idle_timeout` and `query_execution_timeout`, both of which are of type `duration`."}, {"human": "I see, and how would I go about changing these settings?", "assistant": "To change the settings, you would use EdgeQL commands to update the configuration properties. For example, if you wanted to change the `session_idle_timeout`, you might use a command like this:\n```eql\nCONFIGURE DATABASE SET session_idle_timeout := <duration>'00:10:00';\n```\nThis command sets the `session_idle_timeout` to 10 minutes. The exact command can vary depending on whether you're configuring the instance or the database, and whether you're setting a session or system configuration."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the clarification!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or its configuration, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what the 'Auth' type is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'Auth' type in EdgeDB is an object type that's used to specify a client authentication profile. It's part of the configuration system in EdgeDB and allows you to define rules for how clients can authenticate to the database."}, {"human": "I see. How would I go about creating an authentication rule using this type?", "assistant": "To create an authentication rule, you would use the `configure instance insert Auth` command in EdgeDB. Here's an example of how to insert a new authentication rule with the highest priority that uses the 'Trust' method, which means no password is required for clients to connect:\n```edgeql\nconfigure instance insert Auth {\n    priority := 0,\n    method := (insert Trust)\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What does the 'priority' property do?", "assistant": "The 'priority' property of the 'Auth' class determines the order in which authentication rules are evaluated. Rules with a lower priority number are evaluated first. This is important because once a rule matches, no further rules are considered. So, you can have multiple authentication rules, and the one with the highest priority (which is the lowest number) will be applied first."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what ConnectionTransport is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `ConnectionTransport` is an enumeration type that lists the various protocols that EdgeDB can use for communication. It defines the possible values for the transport layer protocol when establishing a connection to the EdgeDB server."}, {"human": "What are the possible values for ConnectionTransport?", "assistant": "The documentation doesn't provide the specific values for `ConnectionTransport`. However, typically, such an enumeration would include protocols like TCP/IP, SSL/TLS for secure connections, or perhaps WebSocket. To get the exact values, you would need to refer to the EdgeDB documentation or source code."}, {"human": "I see, how would I use ConnectionTransport in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You would use `ConnectionTransport` when configuring your database connection settings. For example, when you're setting up a client application to connect to an EdgeDB server, you might specify the transport protocol in the connection configuration. The exact usage would depend on the client library or tool you're using to connect to EdgeDB."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to set the transport protocol in a connection string?", "assistant": "I'm sorry, but the documentation snippet provided doesn't include an example of how to set the transport protocol in a connection string. However, in general, a connection string might look something like this, with a placeholder for where the transport protocol would be specified:\n\n```\nedgedb://user:password@host:port/database?transport=TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL_VALUE\n```\n\nYou would replace `TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL_VALUE` with the actual value for the protocol you wish to use, such as `tcp` or `ssl`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to create a custom scalar type in EdgeDB that only accepts strings starting with the letter 'A'. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can create a custom scalar type with a constraint that checks if the string starts with a certain character. Here's an example using the `expression` constraint:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me how to do that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you can define a scalar type called `StartsWithA` that extends the built-in `str` type and includes a constraint to ensure the string starts with the letter 'A':\n```sdl\nscalar type StartsWithA extending str {\n    constraint expression on (__subject__[0] = 'A');\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so `__subject__` refers to the value being checked by the constraint?", "assistant": "Exactly! In the context of the constraint, `__subject__` refers to the value of the scalar type instance being validated. The expression `__subject__[0] = 'A'` checks if the first character of the string is 'A'."}, {"human": "What if I want to make sure the string doesn't just start with 'A', but also is at least 3 characters long?", "assistant": "You can combine multiple conditions in the expression. Here's how you can modify the constraint to check both conditions:\n```sdl\nscalar type StartsWithA extending str {\n    constraint expression on (__subject__[0] = 'A' and len(__subject__) >= 3);\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And how would I use this custom scalar type in a property of another type?", "assistant": "You would use it just like any other scalar type. For example, if you have a type `Product` with a property `name` that should start with 'A', you would define it like this:\n```sdl\ntype Product {\n    required name: StartsWithA;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That's clear now. Thanks for your help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what the 'std::exclusive' constraint does in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'std::exclusive' constraint in EdgeDB is used to ensure that a link or property value is unique across all instances of a particular type. When you apply this constraint to a property or link, it means that no two objects of that type can have the same value for that property or link."}, {"human": "I see, so it's like a uniqueness constraint. How would I apply it to a property in my schema?", "assistant": "To apply the 'std::exclusive' constraint to a property, you would include it in the property definition within your schema. Here's an example using Schema Definition Language (SDL):\n``sdl\ntype User {\n  required username: str {\n    constraint std::exclusive;\n  };\n}\n``\nIn this example, the 'username' property of the 'User' type must be unique across all 'User' instances."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I want to apply it to a multi link? How does that work?", "assistant": "When you apply the 'std::exclusive' constraint to a `multi` link or property, it ensures that the set of values for each object is unique and does not intersect with the set of values of any other object of the same type. Here's how you might define it in SDL:\n``sdl\ntype Article {\n  multi authors: Person {\n    constraint std::exclusive;\n  };\n}\n``\nIn this case, the set of 'Person' objects linked as 'authors' to any 'Article' object will be unique to that 'Article'. No two 'Article' objects can have the same set of 'Person' objects as 'authors'."}, {"human": "That makes sense. So if I have two articles, they can't share the same author, right?", "assistant": "Actually, it's a bit different. Two articles can share the same author, but the entire set of authors for one article cannot be identical to the set of authors of another article. Each article can have a unique combination of authors. If Article A has authors [Person1, Person2] and Article B has authors [Person2, Person3], that's fine. But if Article B also had authors [Person1, Person2], that would violate the 'std::exclusive' constraint."}, {"human": "Ah, I understand now.

How does the `one_of` constraint work exactly?", "assistant": "The `one_of` constraint specifies that the value of the scalar type must be one of the values provided in the list. When you use this constraint, any attempt to set the scalar type to a value not included in the list will result in an error. This ensures that your `Status` field can only contain 'Open', 'Closed', or 'Merged'."}, {"human": "I see. And what if I want to add more allowed values later on?", "assistant": "If you need to add more allowed values to the `Status` type in the future, you can update the SDL by adding the new values to the `one_of` constraint list and then apply the updated schema to your database.

The `max_ex_value` constraint sets an upper limit that is not included in the allowed range. So in this case, the value `100` would not be valid for the `Under100` type."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to insert a value of 100 for a property of this type?", "assistant": "If you attempt to insert a value of `100` for a property of the `Under100` type, EdgeDB will raise a constraint violation error because `100` is not a valid value for this type."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

Here's how you can define it in SDL:"}, {"human": "Okay, can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's an example of how you would define a scalar type for an email address with a minimum length constraint of 3 characters:\n```\nsdl\nscalar type EmailAddress extending str {\n    constraint min_len_value(3);\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Great, that looks simple enough. And how would I use this in a property for a user type?", "assistant": "You would use the `EmailAddress` scalar type as the type for a property in your `User` type. Here's an example:\n```\nsdl\ntype User {\n    required email: EmailAddress;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That's perfect, thanks! And if I wanted to change the minimum length to 5, would I just replace the 3 with a 5 in the constraint?", "assistant": "Exactly!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to create a custom scalar type in EdgeDB that only accepts letters. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can define a custom scalar type that extends the built-in `str` type and use the `regexp` constraint to ensure that only letter characters are allowed. Here's an example of how you can define such a type:"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's the SDL code snippet for creating a scalar type that only accepts letters:\n```\nsdl\nscalar type LettersOnly extending str {\n    constraint regexp(r'[A-Za-z]*');\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What does the 'r' before the pattern mean?", "assistant": "The 'r' before the pattern indicates that the string is a raw string literal. It tells EdgeDB to interpret the string exactly as it is, without processing escape characters like '\\n' for newline or '\\t' for tab. In the context of regular expressions, it ensures that the backslashes in the pattern are treated literally, as they are often used to escape special characters in the regex syntax."}, {"human": "I see. And what if I want to make sure the string contains only uppercase letters?", "assistant": "If you want to constrain the values to only uppercase letters, you can modify the regular expression pattern accordingly. Here's the updated SDL code:\n```\nsdl\nscalar type UppercaseLettersOnly extending str {\n    constraint regexp(r'[A-Z]*');\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That's perfect, thanks! And where can I learn more about regular expressions in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You're welcome! To learn more about regular expressions and their patterns in EdgeDB, you can refer to the official EdgeDB documentation on regular expression patterns.

It's important to note that all dates and times must correspond to those that exist in the proleptic Gregorian calendar."}, {"human": "Okay, but how do I create a datetime value in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "You can create a `datetime` value by casting a string to `datetime`. Here's a simple example using EdgeQL: \n```edgeql\nselect <datetime>'2018-05-07T15:01:22.306916+00';\nselect <datetime>'2018-05-07T15:01:22+00';\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. So the string format should be in ISO 8601 format, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The string should be in the ISO 8601 format, which includes the date, time, and timezone offset. This ensures that the datetime value is timezone-aware."}, {"human": "Is there anything else I should know about using datetime in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "That's the basics of using `datetime`. Just remember to use the correct string format when casting, and you'll be able to work with datetime values in your queries and schema definitions."}]}

For example:\n```json\n{\n  '2018-05-14T20:07:11.755827Z'\n}\n```Please note that the actual output will reflect the current date and time when you run the query."}, {"human": "Can I use this function in a computed property?", "assistant": "No, you cannot use `std::datetime_current()` in computed properties because it is a volatile function. It always returns the current time when it is called, which is not suitable for computed properties that should only change when their dependent data changes."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to get the timestamp of when my transaction started in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `std::datetime_of_transaction()` function to get the date and time of the start of the current transaction."}, {"human": "Oh, that sounds useful. How does it work exactly?", "assistant": "This function is non-volatile, which means it returns the current time at the moment the transaction starts, not when the function is actually called. So, every time you call it within the same transaction, it will return the same datetime value."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple EdgeQL query that uses `std::datetime_of_transaction()` to get the transaction's start time:\n```eql\nSELECT std::datetime_of_transaction();\n```"}, {"human": "Great, and can I use this function in computed properties as well?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use `std::datetime_of_transaction()` in computed properties. For example, if you have a type `Order` and you want to add a computed property that records when the order was processed, you could define it like this:\n```sdl\ntype Order {\n  processed_at := std::datetime_of_transaction();\n}\n```"}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! Does this mean the `processed_at` property will always show the transaction start time even if I query it later?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `processed_at` computed property will be set to the time when the transaction that created or updated the `Order` instance started. It will not change with subsequent queries."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what the function datetime_of_statement() does in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The function `std::datetime_of_statement()` in EdgeDB returns the date and time of when the current statement began execution. It's a non-volatile function, which means it will return the same value throughout the execution of the statement, regardless of how many times it's called within that statement."}, {"human": "So, does that mean if I use it in a query that takes a long time to run, it will still return the time at which the query started, not when it finished?", "assistant": "Exactly! No matter how long the query takes to execute, `std::datetime_of_statement()` will always return the timestamp from when the execution started. This can be particularly useful for debugging or for tracking when certain operations were initiated."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use this function in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example of how you might use `std::datetime_of_statement()` in a query:\n```eql\nSELECT {\n  start_time := std::datetime_of_statement()\n};\n```\nThis query will return an object with a single property `start_time` that contains the datetime value of when the query started."}, {"human": "Is it possible to use this function in computed properties within a schema?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use `std::datetime_of_statement()` in computed properties within your schema. For example, if you have a type `Event` and you want to automatically record when an event was created, you could do something like this:\n```sdl\ntype Event {\n  required name: str;\n  creation_time := std::datetime_of_statement();\n}\n```\nThis will create a computed property `creation_time` that records the datetime when the `Event` instance was created."}]}

Can you show me an example of how to use it to get the day of the month?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example EdgeQL query that extracts the day of the month from a `local_date`: ```eql SELECT cal::date_get(dt := <local_date>'2023-04-01', el := 'day'); ``` This query will return `1`, since April 1st is the first day of the month."}, {"human": "What other elements can I extract with this function?", "assistant": "With `cal::date_get()`, you can extract several elements from a `local_date`. Here are some of them: - `'century'` - the century according to the Gregorian calendar - `'day'` - the day of the month (1-31) - `'decade'` - the decade ... and so on. Each element you extract will be returned as a `float64` type."}, {"human": "Can I also get the century of a given date?", "assistant": "Yes, you can. Here's how you would write a query to get the century of a given date: ```eql SELECT cal::date_get(dt := <local_date>'2023-04-01', el := 'century'); ``` This will return `21` since the year 2023 is in the 21st century."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to use the duration_get function in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The `duration_get` function in EdgeDB is used to retrieve a specific element of a duration, such as the number of years, months, days, etc., given a unit name. You can use it with different types of duration like `std::duration`, `cal::relative_duration`, or `cal::date_duration`.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how to work with time durations in EdgeDB. Can you explain the gotchas mentioned in the documentation?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, when you're dealing with time durations, it's important to be aware of the concept of 'size classes.' These are categories of time units that are logical breakpoints, beyond which it's not reliable to convert values. For example, a month can vary in length - it could be 30, 28, 29, or 31 days. Similarly, a day is usually 24 hours, but there are exceptions like daylight saving changes. Because of these irregularities, calculations across different size classes can lead to inaccuracies."}, {"human": "So how do I handle calculations within a specific size class?", "assistant": "When you perform calculations, you should do so within the same size class to ensure accuracy. For instance, if you're calculating the total number of days for a certain period, you should keep your calculations to days and avoid converting to months. EdgeDB provides functions that can help you with these calculations, but you need to be mindful of the size class you're working with."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use these functions?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a function that calculates the total number of hours for a given time period within the 'day' size class. Here's a hypothetical example of how you might define such a function in EdgeQL: \n```edgedb\nfunction calculate_total_hours(el: duration) -> int64 {\n    # Your calculation logic here, which should remain within the 'day' size class\n    # For example, you might sum the hours without converting to days or months\n    return <int64>el.total_hours;\n}\n``` \nIn this function, `el` is the duration element you pass in, and the function returns the total number of hours as an integer. Remember, this is just a simplified example to illustrate the concept."}, {"human": "I see, so I should always be careful when dealing with durations. Is there anything else I should watch out for?", "assistant": "Yes, always be cautious with duration calculations. Additionally, be aware of the context in which you're using these durations. For example, if you're working with scheduling or billing systems where precision is crucial, you'll want to ensure that your calculations account for these irregularities. It's also a good practice to document your assumptions and the size class you're working within to avoid confusion later on."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm working with dates in EdgeDB and I need to truncate a datetime value to a specific precision. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely!

And what happens if I don't provide the optional format string when using a string as input?", "assistant": "If you don't provide the optional format string when using a string as input, EdgeDB will use a default date format to parse the string. If your date string is in a different format, you should provide the corresponding format string to ensure correct parsing."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of using a format string?", "assistant": "Sure! If your date string is in the format 'dd-mm-yyyy', you would use the function like this:\n```eql\ncal::to_local_date('01-04-2023', 'dd-mm-yyyy')\n```\nThis tells EdgeDB to interpret the first part of the string as the day, the second part as the month, and the last part as the year."}]}

In EdgeDB, `cal::relative_duration` is a type used to represent a span of time that is relative, rather than precise. This is different from `std::duration`, which is a precise measurement of time. The key difference is that `cal::relative_duration` can include months and days, and the actual amount of time it represents can vary depending on the start date you're measuring from."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how a 'cal::relative_duration' might vary?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a `cal::relative_duration` of 1 month. If you add this duration to January 31st, the resulting date would be February 28th or 29th, depending on whether it's a leap year. However, if you add the same 1-month duration to February 1st, the resulting date would be March 1st. So, even though the relative duration is the same, the actual time span it covers is different because of the varying number of days in each month."}, {"human": "How would I use 'cal::relative_duration' in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "You can use `cal::relative_duration` in EdgeQL when you need to perform operations that involve relative time spans. For example, if you want to add a relative duration to a specific date, you could write an EdgeQL query like this:\n```eql\nSELECT <datetime>'2023-01-01T00:00:00' + <cal::relative_duration>'P1M';\n```\nThis query adds a relative duration of 1 month to the date January 1st, 2023.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm having some trouble understanding how EdgeDB handles durations, especially when adding months. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, when you're working with durations, particularly with months, the arithmetic can be a bit tricky due to the `relative_duration` logic. This can sometimes lead to non-associative behavior."}, {"human": "What do you mean by non-associative behavior?", "assistant": "Non-associative behavior means that the result of an operation can change depending on how the operands are grouped. For example, when adding months to a date, if you add one month at a time, the result can differ from adding two months at once."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you want to add two months to January 31st, 2021. If you add one month at a time, the result might not be what you expect.

How can I avoid this issue?", "assistant": "It can be confusing indeed. The best way to avoid surprises is to be aware of this behavior and test your date arithmetic carefully. When in doubt, perform operations step by step and check the intermediate results to ensure they match your expectations."}]}

The `cal::date_duration` type in EdgeDB is used to represent a span of time specifically in terms of days. It's similar to the `cal::relative_duration` type, but `cal::date_duration` only uses two units for measurement: months and days. You would typically get a `cal::date_duration` value as a result of subtracting one `cal::local_date` from another. This type is particularly useful because it allows you to perform addition and subtraction operations on dates."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use cal::date_duration in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have two `cal::local_date` values and you want to find the duration between them.

For example, if you were indexing text in Spanish, you would use `fts::PGLanguage.Spanish`. Just make sure that the language you want to use is supported by your PostgreSQL installation."}, {"human": "Thanks! That makes sense. Is there a list of all the languages supported by this enum?", "assistant": "The `fts::PGLanguage` enum will include all the languages supported by the PostgreSQL full-text search feature.

It can be used with different types of data, such as strings, bytes, arrays, ranges, and multiranges. The function returns a boolean value: 'true' if the needle is found within the haystack, and 'false' otherwise."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use it with strings?", "assistant": "Sure! If you want to check if a substring is present within a string, you can use the 'contains' function like this:\n```eql\nSELECT std::contains('EdgeDB is awesome', 'EdgeDB');\n```\nThis query will return 'true' because the string 'EdgeDB' is indeed a substring of 'EdgeDB is awesome'."}, {"human": "What about using it with arrays?", "assistant": "When using 'contains' with arrays, you can check if an element is part of the array. Here's an example:\n```eql\nSELECT std::contains(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'banana');\n```\nThis will return 'true' because 'banana' is an element of the array."}, {"human": "And how does it work with ranges?", "assistant": "With ranges, you can check if one range is entirely contained within another range, or if a specific point is within a range. For example:\n```eql\nSELECT std::contains(1 TO 10, 3 TO 7);\n```\nThis will return 'true' because the range 3 TO 7 is completely within the range 1 TO 10.\n\nAnd to check if a point is within a range:\n```eql\nSELECT std::contains(1 TO 10, 5);\n```\nThis will also return 'true' because the point 5 is within the range 1 TO 10."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to find the position of a substring within a string in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely!

You would use the function like this:\n```eql\nSELECT std::find('haystack', 'needle');\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to find a sequence of bytes within a bytes object?", "assistant": "The `std::find()` function also works with bytes. Here's an example where we're looking for a sequence of bytes within another bytes object:\n```eql\nSELECT std::find(b'haystack', b'needle');\n```"}, {"human": "And what about searching within an array?", "assistant": "When searching within an array, you can also specify the starting position with the `from_pos` argument. Here's how you do it:\n```eql\nSELECT std::find(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 'c', from_pos := 0);\n```\nThis will return the index of the element 'c' starting from the beginning of the array."}, {"human": "What does it return if the substring or element isn't found?", "assistant": "If the `std::find()` function doesn't find the specified needle, it will return -1 to indicate that the substring or element was not found in the haystack."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to compare values for inequality in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can compare two values for inequality using the '!=' operator. It returns a boolean value: 'true' if the values are not equal, and 'false' if they are equal."}, {"human": "Could you give me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you want to compare two integers to check if they are not equal. You would write the query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect 3 != 4;\n```\nThis query would return `{true}` because 3 and 4 are not equal."}, {"human": "What if I compare a float and an integer?", "assistant": "EdgeDB will allow you to compare a float and an integer. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect 3 != 3.0;\n```\nThis would return `{false}` because EdgeDB considers the integer 3 and the float 3.0 to be equal in value."}, {"human": "I see. And what about comparing arrays or tuples?", "assistant": "When comparing arrays, EdgeDB checks if the arrays have the same elements in the same order. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect [1, 2] != [2, 1];\n```\nThis query returns `{false}` because the order of elements is considered in arrays, and these two arrays have the same elements in the same order.\n\nFor tuples, the comparison is similar. EdgeDB compares the values in the order they appear. For instance:\n```edgeql\nselect (1, 2) != (x := 1, y := 2);\n```\nThis would return `{false}` because the tuples have the same values in the same order, even though the element names 'x' and 'y' are not used in the first tuple."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if the names of the elements in the tuples are different?", "assistant": "The names of the elements in the tuples do not affect the comparison. It's the values and their order that matter. So if you compare two tuples with different element names but the same values in the same order, the result will be `{false}`. Here's an example:\n```edgeql\nselect (x := 1, y := 2) != (a := 1, b := 2);\n```\nThis query returns `{false}` because the values are equal and in the same order, despite the elements being named differently."}, {"human": "What about comparing strings?", "assistant": "Comparing strings is straightforward. If the strings are not identical, the result will be `{true}`. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect 'hello' != 'world';\n```\nThis will return `{true}` because 'hello' and 'world' are different strings."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the '?=' operator works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The '?=' operator in EdgeDB is used to compare two values for equality, and it's specifically designed to handle optional values. This means that it can compare two potentially empty sets. If both sets are empty, they are considered equal. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say you want to compare the integer 1 with the floating-point number 1.0, and you're not sure if they are considered equal in EdgeDB. You can use the '?=' operator like this:\n```edgeql\nselect {1} ?= {1.0};\n```\nWhen you run this query, the result will be `{true}`, because 1 and 1.0 are equal in value."}, {"human": "What happens if one of the values is an empty set?", "assistant": "If one of the values is an empty set, the '?=' operator will consider it not equal to a non-empty set. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect {1} ?= {};\n```\nThis query will return `{false}` because the set containing the integer 1 is not equal to an empty set."}, {"human": "And what if both values are empty sets?", "assistant": "If both values are empty sets, the '?=' operator will consider them equal. So, if you compare two empty sets like this:\n```edgeql\nselect {} ?= {};\n```\nThe result will be `{true}` because two empty sets are considered equal."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! Is this operator commonly used?", "assistant": "Yes, the '?=' operator can be quite useful when you're dealing with optional data and you need to perform equality checks that include the possibility of empty sets. It ensures that your comparisons are accurate even when some values might be missing."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the inequality operator works in EdgeDB when dealing with optional values. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can use the `?!=` operator to compare two values for inequality, including optional values that might be empty. This operator works similarly to the regular `!=` operator, but it also allows you to compare an empty set `{}` with other values."}, {"human": "So, how does it behave when both sides are empty sets?", "assistant": "When you compare two empty sets using the `?!=` operator, they are considered equal. So, `{}` ?!= `{}` would return `false` because both sides are empty and thus equal."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use this operator?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example where we compare two non-empty sets that contain the same value:\n```edgeql\nselect {2} ?!= {2};\n```\nThis query would return `{false}` because the two sets contain the same integer value, so they are not unequal."}, {"human": "What if one of the sets is empty?", "assistant": "If one of the sets is empty, the `?!=` operator will consider the values unequal. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect {1} ?!= {};\n```\nIn this case, the result would be `{true}` because the first set contains a value while the second set is empty."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the 'less than' operator works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, the 'less than' operator is used to compare two values. It returns `true` if the value on the left side is less than the value on the right side. The syntax for this operator is simply `<`. Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me some examples.", "assistant": "Alright, here are a few examples using the EdgeQL REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which is the interactive shell for EdgeDB:\n\n```edgeql\nselect 1 < 2;  # This will return {true} because 1 is less than 2\nselect 2 < 2;  # This will return {false} because 2 is not less than 2\nselect 'hello' < 'world';  # This will return {true} because 'hello' is lexicographically less than 'world'\nselect (1, 'hello') < (1, 'world');  # This will return {true} because the tuple (1, 'hello') is less than (1, 'world') when compared element-wise\n```\n\nThe comparisons are done based on the type of the operands. For numbers, it's numerical comparison, for strings, it's lexicographical, and for tuples, it's element-wise comparison."}, {"human": "What happens if I compare different types, like an integer with a string?", "assistant": "EdgeDB will raise an error if you try to compare values of different types using the 'less than' operator. Each operand must be of a comparable type. For example, you can't compare an integer directly with a string because they are not directly comparable."}, {"human": "Got it. And can I use this operator in a WHERE clause when querying the database?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can use the 'less than' operator in a WHERE clause to filter query results. For instance, if you have a `Movie` type with a `release_year` property, you could find all movies released before the year 2000 with the following query:\n\n```edgeql\nselect Movie\nwhere Movie.release_year < 2000;\n```\n\nThis query selects all movies where the `release_year` is less than 2000."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! One last thing, can I use this operator with dates?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use the 'less than' operator with date and time types as well. For example, if you want to find events that are scheduled before a certain date, you could write a query like this:\n\n```edgeql\nselect Event\nwhere Event.scheduled_date < <datetime>'2023-01-01T00:00:00Z';\n```\n\nThis would select all events with a `scheduled_date` that is less than January 1st, 2023."}]}

In EdgeDB, the greater than operator is used to compare two values. It returns `true` if the value on the left side is greater than the value on the right side. The syntax looks like this: `anytype > anytype -> bool`."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use it with numbers?", "assistant": "Sure! If you want to compare two numbers to see if one is greater than the other, you would use the operator like this in an EdgeQL query: ```edgeql SELECT 1 > 2; -- This will return {false} SELECT 3 > 2; -- This will return {true} ```"}, {"human": "What about comparing strings?", "assistant": "Comparing strings works in a similar way. The comparison is based on lexicographical order.

When comparing tuples, the comparison is done element by element from left to right. Here's an example: ```edgeql SELECT (1, 'hello') > (1, 'world'); -- This will return {false} ``` The first elements of the tuples are equal, so the comparison moves to the second element, where 'hello' is not greater than 'world'."}]}

For example, to get the length of a bytes object or an array, you would use it like this: ```edgeql-repl db> select len(b'your_bytes_here'); db> select len([your, array, elements]);``` Just replace 'your_bytes_here' and '[your, array, elements]' with the actual bytes or array you're working with."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example with actual values?", "assistant": "Of course! Here are a few examples using actual values: ```edgeql-repl db> select len('foo'); {3} db> select len(b'bar'); {3} db> select len([2, 5, 7]); {3} ``` As you can see, the string 'foo', the bytes b'bar', and the array [2, 5, 7] all have 3 elements, so the `len()` function returns 3 for each of them."}, {"human": "That's clear now.

Could you show me how to use the `to_json()` function with an example?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you can use the `to_json()` function to convert a string that contains JSON data into a JSON value in EdgeDB:\n```edgeql\nselect to_json('{\"hello\": \"world\"}');\n```\nThis will return a JSON object with the content `{\"hello\": \"world\"}`."}, {"human": "What about casting a value to JSON? How does that work?", "assistant": "Casting a value to JSON is quite straightforward. You can cast a string to JSON by using the `<json>` cast operator.

There are also optional parameters to control the behavior when the path is missing or when the new value is empty."}, {"human": "I see. Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a JSON object `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}` and you want to update the value of key 'a' to 3.

However, you can control this behavior with the `create_if_missing` parameter. If you set it to `false`, the function will not create a new path. For example:\n```edgeql\nSELECT std::json_set(\n  to_json('{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}'),\n  'c',\n  value := to_json('3'),\n  create_if_missing := false\n);\n```\nSince 'c' doesn't exist and `create_if_missing` is `false`, the original JSON object will be returned unchanged."}, {"human": "And what does the empty_treatment parameter do?", "assistant": "The `empty_treatment` parameter determines how the function should treat empty JSON values. The default is `JsonEmpty.ReturnEmpty`, which means if the new value is empty, the function will return an empty JSON object. Alternatively, you can use `JsonEmpty.Error` to raise an error if the new value is empty, or `JsonEmpty.KeepOld` to keep the old value if the new one is empty. Here's an example where we try to set an empty value and choose to keep the old one:\n```edgeql\nSELECT std::json_set(\n  to_json('{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}'),\n  'a',\n  value := to_json(''),\n  empty_treatment := JsonEmpty.KeepOld\n);\n```\nIn this case, the value at path 'a' will remain as 1."}]}

This allows you to include various types of data in your JSON object."}, {"human": "What if I have a set of data that I want to turn into a JSON object? Do I have to manually create each tuple?", "assistant": "Not necessarily. If you have a set of data, you can use a SELECT query to generate the tuples dynamically. For example, if you have a table with 'name' and 'value' columns, you could do something like this:\n```edgeql\nselect json_object_pack(\n    (select MyTable {\n        ('name', to_json(.name)),\n        ('value', to_json(.value))\n    })\n);\n```\nThis would pack each row of MyTable into a JSON object with 'name' and 'value' keys."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! And what happens if there are duplicate keys?", "assistant": "In the case of duplicate keys, the behavior is similar to what happens with JSON objects in general: the last key-value pair encountered in the set will be the one that's included in the resulting JSON object.

You specify the start index `from` and the end index `to`, and it returns a new JSON value containing only the part of the original JSON value within that range."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use it with a JSON string?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example where we slice a JSON string to get the first two characters:\n```edgeql\nselect 'hello'[0:2];\n```\nThe result of this query will be a JSON string containing just the characters 'he':\n```\n{Json(\"\\\"he\\\"\")}\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to get the rest of the string starting from a certain position?", "assistant": "If you want to get the rest of the string starting from a certain position, you can omit the `to` index in the slice. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect 'hello'[2:];\n```\nThis will return a JSON string with the rest of the characters starting from index 2:\n```\n{Json(\"\\\"llo\\\"\")}\n```"}, {"human": "Does this work on JSON arrays as well?", "assistant": "Yes, it does! You can use the same slicing syntax on JSON arrays to get a portion of the array. For instance, if you have a JSON array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and you want to get the first two elements, you would use:\n```edgeql\nselect [1, 2, 3, 4][0:2];\n```\nThe result would be a new JSON array containing just `[1, 2]`."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to concatenate JSON values in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can concatenate JSON arrays, objects, or strings using the '++' operator. This will combine two JSON values of the same type into a new JSON value."}, {"human": "So, how does it work if I want to concatenate two JSON objects?", "assistant": "When you concatenate two JSON objects, the result is a new object that contains a union of the keys from both input objects. If both objects have the same key, the value from the second object will be used in the resulting object."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of concatenating JSON objects?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an EdgeQL example that concatenates two JSON objects:\n```eql\nSELECT json_object('{\"a\": 1}') ++ json_object('{\"b\": 2, \"a\": 3}');\n```\nThe result of this operation would be a JSON object: `{\"a\": 3, \"b\": 2}`. Notice how the value of 'a' from the second object overrides the first one."}, {"human": "What about concatenating JSON arrays?", "assistant": "Concatenating JSON arrays will append the elements of the second array to the first one. Here's how you can do it:\n```eql\nSELECT json_array('[1, 2]') ++ json_array('[3, 4]');\n```\nThe result will be a single JSON array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`."}, {"human": "And if I want to concatenate JSON strings?", "assistant": "Concatenating JSON strings is just like concatenating regular strings.

In EdgeDB, you can access elements of a JSON object using the `json[]` operator. You simply provide the key of the element you want to access. For example, if you have a JSON object `{'a': 2, 'b': 5}`, you can access the value of key 'b' like this: `select to_json('{\"a\": 2, \"b\": 5}')['b'];`"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. Could you show me an example of how that works in the EdgeDB REPL?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you would do it in the EdgeDB REPL:\n```edgeql-repl\ndb> select to_json('{\"a\": 2, \"b\": 5}')['b'];\n{Json(\"5\")}\n```This command selects the value associated with the key 'b' from the JSON object and returns it as a JSON type."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I want to access a JSON field from a variable that holds a JSON object?", "assistant": "If you have a variable that holds a JSON object, you can access its fields in a similar way. For example, if you have a variable `j` that contains a JSON object, you can access a field like this:\n```edgeql\ndb> select j := to_json('{\"a\": 2, \"b\": 5}')['a'];\n{Json(\"2\")}\n```This will give you the value associated with the key 'a' from the JSON object stored in variable `j`."}, {"human": "What if the JSON object is part of a query that fetches data from the database schema?", "assistant": "If you're fetching data from the database schema and you want to include a JSON object with specific fields, you can construct the JSON object within the query. Here's an example where we fetch the name of a type and also include a current timestamp as a JSON object:\n```edgeql\nselect schema::Type {\n    name,\n    timestamp := to_json(cal::to_local_date(datetime_current()))\n};\n```\nIn this query, `name` is a regular field of the `schema::Type`, and `timestamp` is a JSON object created from the current datetime converted to a local date."}]}

EdgeDB provides a function called `to_json()` that you can use to parse a JSON value from a string. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's how you can use the `to_json()` function in EdgeQL to parse a JSON array and a JSON object from strings:\n\n```edgeql\nselect to_json('[1, \"hello\", null]');\n-- This will return: {Json(\"[1, \\\"hello\\\", null]\")}\n\nselect to_json('{\"hello\": \"world\"}');\n-- This will return: {Json(\"{\\\"hello\\\": \\\"world\\\"}\")}\n```"}, {"human": "Great, that looks simple enough. What if my JSON string is invalid?", "assistant": "If the JSON string you provide to `to_json()` is invalid, EdgeDB will raise an error.

Can you tell me more about it?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `std::json_array_unpack()` function to unpack a JSON array. This function returns the elements of a JSON array as a set of `json`."}, {"human": "Sounds useful. How exactly do I use it in a query?", "assistant": "You can use it in your EdgeQL queries like this:\n```eql\nSELECT std::json_array_unpack(json := '[1, 2, 3]');\n```\nThis will return a set of json elements `1`, `2`, and `3`. Remember to pass a JSON array to the function, otherwise, you'll get a runtime error."}, {"human": "What happens if I pass something that's not a JSON array?", "assistant": "If you pass a non-array JSON value to `std::json_array_unpack()`, EdgeDB will raise a runtime error because the function expects an array. Make sure to only use it with JSON arrays."}, {"human": "Is there anything else I should be aware of when using this function?", "assistant": "Just keep in mind that `std::json_array_unpack()` should be used when the ordering of elements is not important, or when you're certain that the ordering of the elements will not affect your use case. Since it returns a set, the order is not guaranteed."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to extract some data from a JSON object in EdgeDB but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can use the `std::json_get()` function to retrieve data from a JSON object or array. This function allows you to navigate through the JSON structure safely."}, {"human": "Sounds good. How exactly does this function work?", "assistant": "The `std::json_get()` function takes two arguments: the JSON value you want to query, and a variadic list of strings that represent the path to the data you want to extract. If the path is valid, it returns the JSON value at the end of that path. Otherwise, it returns `None`."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure!

The function takes a single argument of type `anyreal`, which includes both `float64` and `int64` types, and returns the absolute value of the input."}, {"human": "Great, can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you can use `math::abs()` in an EdgeQL query: \n```edgeql\nselect math::abs(-42);\n```\nThis will return `{42}` because the absolute value of `-42` is `42`."}, {"human": "What if I pass a positive number to `math::abs()`?", "assistant": "If you pass a positive number to `math::abs()`, it will simply return that number, since the absolute value of a positive number is the number itself. For example: \n```edgeql\nselect math::abs(42);\n```\nThis will also return `{42}`."}, {"human": "Got it. And this works with floating point numbers as well?", "assistant": "Yes, it does.

If you provide an empty set, the result will be `None` because variance cannot be calculated without data. Also, remember that the function returns the sample variance, not the population variance, which means it's calculated as the sum of squared deviations from the mean, divided by the number of samples minus one."}, {"human": "Thanks for the clarification!

How would I use it with a float number, say 1.1?", "assistant": "To round up the float number 1.1, you would use the function like this in an EdgeQL query: ```edgeql select math::ceil(1.1); ``` This will return `{2}` because `math::ceil()` rounds up to the nearest integer."}, {"human": "What if the number is negative, like -1.1?", "assistant": "The `math::ceil()` function will still round up to the nearest integer. So for -1.1, the query would be: ```edgeql select math::ceil(-1.1); ``` And the result will be `{-1}`, because it rounds up to the nearest integer, which is -1 in this case."}, {"human": "Does it work the same way with integers and big integers?", "assistant": "Yes, it does. When you use `math::ceil()` with an `int64` or `bigint`, it will return the same value if it's already an integer, or the next integer if it's not. For example: ```edgeql select math::ceil(42); ``` This will return `{42}` if `42` is an `int64` or a `bigint`, because it's already an integer."}, {"human": "And what about decimals?", "assistant": "For decimals, `math::ceil()` will also round up to the nearest integer. If you have a decimal value like `1.1`, the query would be: ```edgeql select math::ceil(<decimal>1.1); ``` And it will return the rounded up value as a decimal."}, {"human": "Thanks!

Here's an example of how you can use math::floor() with a float value:\n```edgeql\nselect math::floor(1.1);\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return `{1}` because 1.1 rounded down to the nearest integer is 1."}, {"human": "What if the number is negative?", "assistant": "When the number is negative, math::floor() will still round down to the nearest integer. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect math::floor(-1.1);\n```\nThis query will return `{-2}` because -1.1 rounded down is -2."}, {"human": "Got it.

That's a property of logarithms. The expression e^(ln(x)) equals x, where ln(x) is the natural logarithm of x. So, when you calculate the natural logarithm of a number and then raise e to that power, you should get the original number back, within the precision limits of floating-point arithmetic."}, {"human": "What if I want to use a decimal instead of an integer or float?", "assistant": "If you're working with decimals, you can still use the math::ln() function. The syntax is the same; you just need to make sure that the input value is a decimal. Here's how you would do it:\n\n```edgeql\nselect math::ln(<decimal>100);\n```\n\nThis will return the natural logarithm of 100 as a decimal.

In EdgeDB, the `decimal` type is used for numbers that require arbitrary precision. This means that it can represent very large or very small numbers without losing accuracy, which is important for use cases like financial calculations where precision is crucial."}, {"human": "So, when should I opt to use `decimal` instead of other numeric types?", "assistant": "You should opt to use `decimal` when you need to ensure that the precision of your numbers is maintained throughout calculations. For example, when dealing with money, interest rates, or other financial data, using `decimal` can prevent rounding errors that might occur with floating-point types."}, {"human": "Is there anything special I need to keep in mind when using `decimal`?", "assistant": "Yes, there is. The philosophy behind using `decimal` in EdgeDB is that it should always be an explicit choice. It's not implicitly cast to other numerical types to avoid accidental loss of precision. So, once you decide to use `decimal`, you should handle these values carefully and ensure they remain as `decimal` during operations."}, {"human": "Can you show me how to define a `decimal` field in an EdgeDB schema?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's how you can define a `decimal` field within a type in your schema definition language (SDL):\n```\ntype FinancialRecord {\n  amount: decimal;\n}\n```This defines a type `FinancialRecord` with a `decimal` field named `amount`."}]}

If you want to divide 10 by 4 and get the floor value of the result, you would write the query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect 10 // 4;\n```\nThe result of this query would be `{2}`, because 10 divided by 4 is 2.5, and when you round down, you get 2."}, {"human": "What happens if I use negative numbers?", "assistant": "When you use negative numbers with floor division, the result is still rounded down to the nearest integer.

It's used to find the remainder after division of one number by another."}, {"human": "What happens if I use it with floating-point numbers?", "assistant": "The '%' operator works with floating-point numbers as well. The operation will still give you the remainder after division. For example, if you have `7.5 % 2.2`, the result will be the remainder of the division of 7.5 by 2.2.

Is there anything else I should know about using random numbers in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You're welcome! Just remember that the numbers generated by `std::random()` are pseudo-random, which means they are generated in a way that may seem random, but they are actually deterministic if you know the algorithm used.

For example, if you have a negative number like -8 (which is `11111000` in 8-bit binary) and you shift it to the right by 3 bits, the sign bit is replicated to fill in the vacated positions. Here's how you would write the query:\n\n```eql\nSELECT std::bit_rshift(-8, 3);\n```\n\nThe result would be `-1`, because the binary representation would change from `11111000` to `11111111`, which is `-1` in two's complement binary representation."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And this function can be used with any integer type?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use `bit_rshift` with `int16`, `int32`, and `int64` types in EdgeDB. Just make sure that the first argument is the integer you want to shift, and the second argument is the number of bits you want to shift it by. Both arguments should be of the appropriate integer type."}]}

The '0' is a placeholder for a digit, and it means that leading zeros should be displayed. The '9' is also a placeholder for a digit, but it's used to specify optional digits, which means they will not be displayed if they are not present in the input string."}, {"human": "Got it! And what if I don't provide a format string?", "assistant": "If you don't provide a format string, `to_bigint()` will try to parse the string as a regular integer without any formatting.

In EdgeDB, `bigint` is a type that represents an arbitrary precision integer. This means it can store very large integer values without losing precision. The philosophy behind EdgeDB is that the use of `bigint` should be a deliberate choice. It's not something that the system will automatically opt you into. You should use `bigint` when you're dealing with numbers that are too large for standard integer types and when precision is crucial."}, {"human": "Got it. So how do I make sure I don't accidentally cast a `bigint` to a different numerical type and lose precision?", "assistant": "EdgeDB is designed to prevent accidental casting from `bigint` to other numerical types that could lead to precision loss. When you use `bigint`, you should explicitly handle any conversions to ensure that you're not losing any important data. For example, if you need to convert a `bigint` to a different type, you should do so consciously, understanding that it might involve a loss of precision if the target type has lower capacity."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to define a `bigint` in an EdgeDB schema?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple example of how you might define a `bigint` in an EdgeDB schema using the Schema Definition Language (SDL):\n``sdl\ntype FinancialRecord {\n  id: uuid;\n  balance: bigint;\n}\n``\nIn this example, we have a type `FinancialRecord` with an `id` field of type `uuid` and a `balance` field of type `bigint`. This would be appropriate for financial data where the balance could be a very large number and precision is important."}]}

In EdgeDB, `BaseObject` is the root object type from which all other object types inherit. It's an abstract type, meaning you can't create instances of `BaseObject` directly, but it provides a common set of properties that all objects in the database will have."}, {"human": "What kind of properties does the BaseObject have?", "assistant": "The `BaseObject` has two main properties. First, there's the `id` property, which is a universally unique identifier of the type `uuid`. This `id` is required for every object, has a default value generated by the function `std::uuid_generate_v1mc()`, is read-only, and must be unique across all objects. Second, there's a property that stores the object type information in the schema, but the documentation snippet doesn't provide details on that."}, {"human": "Can you show me what the SDL for BaseObject looks like?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how the `BaseObject` is defined in SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n``sdl\nabstract type std::BaseObject {\n    required id: uuid {\n        default := (select std::uuid_generate_v1mc());\n        readonly := true;\n        constraint exclusive;\n    }\n    # ... other properties related to object type information\n}\n``\nAs you can see, the `id` property is defined with its constraints and default value."}, {"human": "So, if I create a new object type, does it automatically inherit from BaseObject?", "assistant": "Yes, that's correct. Any new object type you define in EdgeDB will inherit from `BaseObject` by default, which means it will automatically have the `id` property with all its constraints and behaviors."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the explanation! That makes sense now.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what an Object is in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, an Object is the root type for user-defined types. It's an abstract type that all other user-defined object types extend from."}, {"human": "So, how do I define a new type that extends from this Object?", "assistant": "You can define a new user-defined type by using the SDL (Schema Definition Language). Here's a basic example:\n``sdl\ntype Person extending std::Object {\n  required name: str;\n  age: int16;\n}\n``\nIn this example, `Person` is a new object type that has two fields: `name` which is required, and `age`."}]}

Trigram matching is a technique used to determine the similarity of text by breaking down words into trigrams, which are groups of three consecutive characters. EdgeDB provides an extension called `ext::pg_trgm` that offers tools for trigram matching. This can be a great supplement to full-text search, which focuses on matching whole words and phrases, often accounting for grammatical variations. Trigram matching, on the other hand, analyzes the similarity between individual words by comparing their trigrams."}, {"human": "Interesting. How would I go about using this in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "To use trigram matching in EdgeDB, you would first need to enable the `ext::pg_trgm` extension in your database schema. Here's a simple example of how you can do this using SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n```\nmodule default {\n  using extension ext::pg_trgm;\n}\n```\nOnce the extension is enabled, you can use the functions it provides to perform trigram-based similarity searches on text fields in your database."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of a function that uses trigram matching?", "assistant": "Sure! Although the specific functions provided by the `ext::pg_trgm` extension are not detailed in the snippet of the documentation you provided, typically such an extension would include functions like similarity comparison and index support for faster searches. In PostgreSQL, for example, you might use the `similarity` function to compare two strings, or create a GIN index on a text column to speed up trigram matching queries. The usage in EdgeDB would be similar, but keep in mind that you'll need to refer to the official EdgeDB documentation or the extension documentation for the exact function names and syntax."}, {"human": "Got it.

The 'word_similarity_threshold' is more specific and applies to individual words within a string. Lastly, the 'strict_word_similarity_threshold' is a stricter version of the word similarity threshold, likely used in scenarios where you need higher precision in matching."}, {"human": "I see. And how do I actually apply these settings?", "assistant": "To apply these settings, you would typically use DDL (Data Definition Language) commands or EdgeDB's configuration system to set the values for these thresholds. The exact method can depend on your application's requirements and the version of EdgeDB you're using. You might set them directly in your database initialization scripts or through an administrative interface provided by EdgeDB."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

The `ext::pg_trgm::strict_word_similar` function is used to compare two strings and determine if they are similar, but with the condition that the match must occur at word boundaries. It's stricter than the `ext::pg_trgm::word_similar` function. Would you like to see an example of how to use it?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure thing!

For example:\n```edgeql\nselect ext::pg_trgm::strict_word_similar(a: 'I love EdgeDB so much', b: 'EdgeDB') -> true;\n```\nHere, 'EdgeDB' is in the middle of the string but it's at the start of a word, so the function returns `true`."}, {"human": "And what happens if the word is not at a word boundary?", "assistant": "If the word is not at a word boundary, the function will return `false`. For instance:\n```edgeql\nselect ext::pg_trgm::strict_word_similar(a: 'EdgeDBrocks', b: 'EdgeDB') -> false;\n```\nIn this case, 'EdgeDB' is not at a word boundary in the string 'EdgeDBrocks', so the function returns `false`."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And this function is part of an extension, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `ext::pg_trgm::strict_word_similar` function is part of the `pg_trgm` extension in PostgreSQL, which is exposed in EdgeDB as an extension. This means that it's not a built-in EdgeDB function, but rather one that's available through integration with PostgreSQL's features."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to compare two strings in EdgeDB and I want to know how similar they are. Is there a function for that?", "assistant": "Yes, EdgeDB provides a function called `ext::pg_trgm::similarity()` that computes the similarity between two strings.

The `word_similarity` function compares the set of trigrams from the first string (a) with every continuous extent of an ordered set of trigrams from the second string (b). The result is the greatest similarity score from these comparisons. The score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 means the strings are identical in terms of trigram sets."}, {"human": "Got it!

To find the intersection of these two ranges, you would use the following EdgeQL query: ```edgeql-repl db> select range(1, 10) * range(5, 15); {range(5, 10)}``` This query will return the range from 5 to 10, which is the intersection of the two ranges."}, {"human": "What if the ranges overlap completely?", "assistant": "If one range is completely within another, the intersection would be the smaller range itself. For example, if you intersect `range(1, 10)` with `range(-15, 15)`, you'll get `range(1, 10)` as the result, since the first range is entirely within the second. Here's how you'd write the query: ```edgeql-repl db> select range(1, 10) * range(-15, 15); {range(1, 10)}```"}, {"human": "And what happens if there is no overlap between the ranges?", "assistant": "If there's no overlap between the ranges, the intersection operator `*` would return an empty set. For example, if you tried to intersect `range(1, 5)` with `range(6, 10)`, there's no common range between them, so the result would be an empty set."}, {"human": "Can this operator be used with multiranges as well?", "assistant": "Yes, the `*` operator can also be used to find the intersection of multiranges. When you apply it between two multiranges, it returns a multirange that represents the intersection of the two. The syntax is similar to that of single ranges."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the explanation!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the range_unpack() function in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! The `range_unpack()` function in EdgeDB is used to return values from a range.

Is there a limit to the type of ranges I can use with this function?", "assistant": "The `range_unpack()` function works with any range of discrete values. Discrete values are values that have a clear, distinct separation, like integers.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how range types work in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they are represented in JSON?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, range types are represented in JSON with a structure that includes four keys: 'inc_lower', 'inc_upper', 'lower', and 'upper'. For example, if you select a range from 1 to 10, the JSON representation would look like this:\n```edgeql-repl\ndb> select range(1, 10);\n{\"inc_lower\": true, \"inc_upper\": false, \"lower\": 1, \"upper\": 10}\n```The 'inc_lower' and 'inc_upper' keys are booleans indicating whether the lower and upper bounds are inclusive, respectively. 'lower' and 'upper' keys hold the actual values of the range's bounds."}, {"human": "So, how would I cast a JSON object to a range type in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "To cast a JSON object to a specific range type, you need to ensure that the JSON object has the correct structure that EdgeDB expects for range types. This means it should have the 'inc_lower', 'inc_upper', 'lower', and 'upper' keys with appropriate values. Once you have a JSON object with this structure, you can cast it to a range type in EdgeQL. Unfortunately, the documentation snippet doesn't provide the exact syntax for this operation, but typically casting in EdgeDB is done using the `<type>` syntax, where `type` is the target data type you want to cast to."}]}

Here's an example where we check if two integer ranges overlap:\n```edgeql\nselect std::overlaps(range(1, 10), range(5, 15));\n```\nThis query will return `{true}` because the two ranges have numbers from 5 to 10 in common."}, {"human": "What if I want to check for multiranges?", "assistant": "The `overlaps()` function also works with multiranges.

When used in the context of a range, like `range(7, {})`, it indicates that the range starts at 7 and goes up to but does not include any other value, effectively making it a single-value range.

In EdgeDB, multiranges are used to represent a collection of ranges. They are particularly useful for modeling intermittent availability or ranges with gaps. A multirange is essentially a set of ranges that are packaged together, allowing you to easily perform range operations on the entire set."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to create a multirange?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's an example of how you can create a multirange using EdgeQL, which is the query language for EdgeDB:\n```edgeql\nSELECT multirange([range(1, 5), range(10, 15), range(20, 25)]);\n```This will create a multirange consisting of three ranges: 1-5, 10-15, and 20-25."}, {"human": "What kind of operations can I perform on a multirange?", "assistant": "You can perform various range operations on a multirange, such as checking if a value is contained within any of the ranges, finding the union or intersection of multiranges, and more. These operations make it easy to work with sets of ranges as a single entity."}, {"human": "Is there a specific data type for multiranges in SDL?", "assistant": "Yes, in the Schema Definition Language (SDL) used to define EdgeDB schemas, you can specify a field as a multirange type. For example:\n```sdl\ntype Schedule {\n  available_times: multirange<int64>;\n}\n```This defines a type 'Schedule' with a field 'available_times' that stores a multirange of 64-bit integers."}]}

Here's how you might write a query with an unspecified lower bound:\n```eql\nSELECT range < range(10, 20);\n```\nAssuming `range` is something like `range(null, 15)`, which means it has an unspecified lower bound, the expression would evaluate to `true` because `null` (unspecified) is considered smaller than 10."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if both ranges have unspecified lower bounds?", "assistant": "If both ranges have unspecified lower bounds, then the comparison would still be based on the lower bounds, but since both are unspecified, the operator would return `false` because neither is considered to be 'before' the other.

In that case, the comparison would be based on the upper bounds or other criteria if the upper bounds are also unspecified."}, {"human": "Got it. And what about multiranges?", "assistant": "The 'multirange >= multirange' operator works similarly to the 'range >= range' operator, but it operates on multiranges.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what sequences are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly!

Is there a function to get the next value?", "assistant": "Yes, there is a function called `sequence_next()` that you can use. It increments the given sequence to its next value and returns that value. This is handy when you want to assign a new unique identifier to a record."}, {"human": "What if I want to reset the sequence? Is that possible?", "assistant": "Absolutely, you can reset a sequence using the `sequence_reset()` function. This function resets a sequence to its initial state or to a given value, and then it returns the value. It's useful if you need to restart the numbering from a specific point."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to create a sequence in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you can define a sequence in SDL:\n``sdl\nsequence MySequence;\n``\nYou can then use this sequence in your schema to auto-increment a field."}, {"human": "And how would I use `sequence_next()` in a query?", "assistant": "To use `sequence_next()`, you would typically do so in an EdgeQL INSERT statement to generate a new value for a field.

How do I define it in my schema?", "assistant": "You can define it by creating a new scalar type that extends `sequence`. Then, you can use this new scalar type for a property in your object type. Here's an example:"}, {"human": "Could you show me the code for that?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how you can define an auto-incrementing property called `number` for a `Ticket` type:"}, {"human": "Please provide the SDL.", "assistant": "```sdl\nscalar type TicketNo extending sequence;\n\ntype Ticket {\n    number: TicketNo {\n        constraint exclusive;\n    }\n}\n```"}, {"human": "What does the 'constraint exclusive' mean here?", "assistant": "The `constraint exclusive` ensures that the `number` property is unique across all instances of the `Ticket` type. This means that no two tickets will have the same number."}, {"human": "And what if I want to use this auto-incrementing number in multiple types?", "assistant": "A sequence is bound to the scalar type, not to the individual property. This means you can use the same `TicketNo` scalar type in multiple object types, and the sequence will continue incrementing across all of them.

Would you like to see an example of how to use it?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's a simple example of how you might use `sequence_next()` in EdgeQL:\n```eql\nSELECT std::sequence_next(seq: <schema::ScalarType>) -> int64;\n```\nIn this snippet, replace `<schema::ScalarType>` with the actual sequence type you've defined in your schema. This function will return the next integer in the sequence, and the sequence will be incremented atomically."}, {"human": "What do you mean by 'atomically'? And how do I specify the sequence?", "assistant": "When an operation is performed 'atomically', it means that the increment to the sequence will be done in a way that's safe from concurrent transactions. Each session or transaction that calls `sequence_next()` will receive a unique value, even if they call the function at the same time.\n\nAs for specifying the sequence, you should have a sequence defined in your schema. Here's an example of how you might define a sequence in SDL:\n```sdl\ntype MySequence extending std::sequence;\n```\nOnce you have your sequence defined, you can pass it to the `sequence_next()` function like this:\n```eql\nSELECT std::sequence_next(seq: MySequence);\n```"}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And what's the best practice for supplying the sequence parameter?", "assistant": "The best practice for supplying the sequence parameter is to ensure that you're referencing the sequence type directly, as shown in the previous example. This helps avoid any ambiguity in your queries. If you follow this practice, you should have no trouble using sequences in your EdgeDB projects."}]}

Would you like to see how to use it with an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, that would be great. Let's say I have a sequence that I want to reset to its initial state.", "assistant": "Alright, if you want to reset a sequence to its initial state, you can use the function like this:\n```eql\nstd::sequence_reset(seq: YourSequenceType);\n```\nReplace `YourSequenceType` with the actual scalar type of your sequence. This will reset the sequence and return its initial value."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I want to reset the sequence to a specific value instead of the initial state?", "assistant": "If you want to reset the sequence to a specific value, you can pass that value as the second argument to the function. Here's how you do it:\n```eql\nstd::sequence_reset(seq: YourSequenceType, val: 100);\n```\nThis will reset your sequence to the value `100` and return that value. Just make sure to replace `YourSequenceType` with the correct type and `100` with the value you want to reset to."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about using sequences?", "assistant": "When specifying your sequence, it's important to follow best practices. Always ensure that the `seq` parameter you supply is the correct scalar type that represents your sequence. If you're unsure about the sequence type, you can check your schema definitions where you have defined the sequence. Also, remember that sequences are typically used to generate unique numeric identifiers, so resetting a sequence might affect the uniqueness of future identifiers."}]}

Is `distinct` only used with numbers or can it be used with other types as well?", "assistant": "The `distinct` operator can be used with sets of any type, not just numbers. It will work with strings, custom object types, or any other EdgeDB-supported data type. The key point is that it will remove duplicates and return a set of distinct elements."}, {"human": "What if I want to use `distinct` with a set of elements from a database query?", "assistant": "You can use `distinct` with the results of a database query just as you would with a literal set. For example, if you have a database with a type `Person` and you want to select all unique names, you could write a query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect distinct (select Person.name);\n```\nThis query will give you a set of distinct names from the `Person` type in your database."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks!

What will it return then?", "assistant": "If the set is empty, the `exists` operator will return `{false}`. For example, if you run the following query with an empty set:\n```edgeql\nselect exists {};\n```\nIt will return `{false}` since there are no elements in the set."}, {"human": "Got it! Is this only for sets of numbers or can it be used with other types as well?", "assistant": "The `exists` operator can be used with sets of any type, not just numbers.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to filter a set based on its type in EdgeDB. Can you explain how that works?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can filter a set by its type using the type intersection operator `[is type]`. This operator removes all elements from the input set that aren't of the specified type. It also guarantees the type of the result set, which means all the links and properties associated with that type are available after the filter is applied."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use this operator in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "Sure!

For instance, if `Movie` has a `title` property and `actors` link, you can access them like this:\n```eql\nSELECT anytype [is Movie] { title, actors { name } };\n```\nThis query will give you the titles of the movies and the names of the actors in those movies."}, {"human": "Got it! And what if I want to filter by a type within a more complex query?", "assistant": "You can use the `[is type]` operator within any part of a query where you need to ensure that you're working with a specific type. For example, if you're querying for all `Person` entities but only want to include their directed movies, you could write:\n```eql\nSELECT Person {\n  name,\n  directed_movies := .movies [is Movie]\n};\n```\nIn this query, `.movies` might return a set of various types, but by using `[is Movie]`, we're filtering that set to only include `Movie` entities."}]}

For example, if there are four User objects, the query will return `{4}`."}, {"human": "Got it. And this function will work with any type of set, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `count()` function works with any set, regardless of the element type. It simply returns the number of elements in the set you provide."}]}

The `sum()` function in EdgeDB is used to calculate the sum of a set of numbers. It can work with different numeric types such as `int32`, `int64`, `float32`, `float64`, `bigint`, and `decimal`. The result type will match the input set type. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example with integers.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say you have a set of integers and you want to calculate the sum. Here's how you would use the `sum()` function in EdgeQL: ```eql SELECT std::sum({1, 2, 3, 4});``` This query will return `10`, which is the sum of the numbers in the set."}, {"human": "What if I have a set of floats? How does that work?", "assistant": "When you're working with floats, the `sum()` function will return a result of type `float32` or `float64` depending on the input set type. Here's an example with `float64`: ```eql SELECT std::sum({1.5, 2.5, 3.5});``` This will return `7.5` as the sum of the float numbers in the set."}, {"human": "Got it. And what if I need to sum up values from a database table?", "assistant": "To sum up values from a table, you would use the `sum()` function on a property of the set of table entries. For example, if you have a `Purchase` type with a `price` property, you could sum all the prices like this: ```eql SELECT std::sum(Purchase.price);``` This query will return the total sum of all `price` values from the `Purchase` entries in your database."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or EdgeQL, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how the all() function works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The `all()` function in EdgeDB is used to determine if all values in a given set are `true`. It returns `true` if none of the values are `false`. This means that if every single value in the set is `true`, or if the set is empty, `all()` will return `true`. If there's at least one `false` value in the set, `all()` will return `false`."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Of course! Here's an example where we use `all()` to check if all numbers in a set are less than 4:\n```edgeql\nselect all({1, 2, 3, 4} < 4);\n```\nIn this case, the set contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The expression `{1, 2, 3, 4} < 4` checks if each number is less than 4. Since 4 is not less than 4, the result of the `all()` function will be `false`."}, {"human": "What if the set is empty?", "assistant": "If the set is empty, `all()` will return `true`. Here's how you can test it:\n```edgeql\nselect all({});\n```\nSince there are no values in the set, there are no `false` values, and therefore `all()` returns `true`."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! So it's basically like a logical AND operation over a set?", "assistant": "Exactly! You can think of `all()` as a way to perform a logical AND operation across all the values in a set. If all values satisfy the condition (are `true`), then the result is `true`. If any value does not satisfy the condition (is `false`), the result is `false`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to use the 'any' function in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! The 'any' function in EdgeDB is used to determine if any value in a given set is `true`. It takes a set of boolean values as an argument and returns `true` if at least one of the values is `true`. If all values are `false`, or the set is empty, it returns `false`."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a set of numbers and you want to check if any of them are less than 4. You could use the 'any' function like this:\n```edgeql\nselect any({1, 2, 3, 4} < 4);\n```\nThis would return `{true}` because there are values in the set (1, 2, 3) that are less than 4."}, {"human": "What if the set is empty? What does 'any' return then?", "assistant": "If the set is empty, 'any' will return `false`. Here's how it looks:\n```edgeql\nselect any({});\n```\nThis query will return `{false}` because there are no values to evaluate to `true`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the enumerate function works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, the `enumerate()` function is used to create a set of tuples from any given set. Each tuple contains two elements: the first is a zero-based index, and the second is the value from the original set. Here's the signature of the function: ```eql std::enumerate(values: set of anytype) -> set of tuple ```"}, {"human": "So, if I have a set of names, how would I use `enumerate()` to get the index with each name?", "assistant": "If you have a set of names, you can use `enumerate()` like this: ```eql WITH names := {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'} SELECT std::enumerate(names); ``` This query will return a set of tuples where each tuple has an index and a name from the set."}, {"human": "What will be the result of this query?", "assistant": "The result will be a set of tuples, each containing an index and a name. It would look something like this: ``` [{0, 'Alice'}, {1, 'Bob'}, {2, 'Charlie'}] ``` Keep in mind that the actual order of the set is not guaranteed, as the documentation notes that the ordering of the returned set by `enumerate()` is not guaranteed."}, {"human": "I see, so the index starts at 0 and goes up by 1 for each element. What if I want to use this in a more complex query?", "assistant": "You can incorporate `enumerate()` into more complex queries by using it within a `SELECT` statement. For example, if you want to filter or process the data further, you could do something like this: ```eql WITH enumerated_names := enumerate({'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}) SELECT (index, name) { index, name_upper := name.upper() } FILTER index = 1; ``` This query would enumerate the names, convert each name to uppercase, and then filter the results to only include the tuple with index 1."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! And what if there are duplicates in the set? How does `enumerate()` handle that?", "assistant": "The `enumerate()` function will treat each occurrence of a duplicate value as a distinct element. So, each occurrence will get its own index. For example: ```eql WITH names := {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice'} SELECT std::enumerate(names); ``` This might return something like: ``` [{0, 'Alice'}, {1, 'Bob'}, {2, 'Alice'}] ``` Again, each 'Alice' is treated separately and given a unique index."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to check if an element is part of a set in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `in` operator to check if an element is a member of a set. The syntax looks like this: `element in set`. If you want to check if an element is not in a set, you can use the `not in` operator. Here's how you can use them:"}, {"human": "Could you give me an example of both operators in action?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a set of movie titles and you want to check if 'The Matrix' is among them. You would write it like this:\n```eql\n'The Matrix' in {'The Matrix', 'Inception', 'Interstellar'};\n```\nThis will return `true` if 'The Matrix' is in the set, and `false` otherwise. To check if 'The Matrix' is not in the set, you would write:\n```eql\n'The Matrix' not in {'Avatar', 'Titanic', 'Inception'};\n```\nThis will return `true` if 'The Matrix' is not in the set, and `false` if it is."}, {"human": "What if I want to check a set against another set?", "assistant": "When you're checking set membership with another set as the left operand, the `in` operator will check each element of the left set to see if it's present in the right set. For example:\n```eql\n{'The Matrix', 'Avatar'} in {'The Matrix', 'Inception', 'Avatar'};\n```\nThis will return a set of booleans, one for each element in the left set, indicating whether each element is in the right set. So the result would be `{true, true}` in this case."}, {"human": "Got it! And what if there's a mix of elements that are and aren't in the set?", "assistant": "If you have a mix, the `in` operator will still return a set of booleans for each element. For instance:\n```eql\n{'The Matrix', 'The Lord of the Rings'} in {'The Matrix', 'Inception', 'Avatar'};\n```\nThe result would be `{true, false}`, because 'The Matrix' is in the set, but 'The Lord of the Rings' is not."}, {"human": "That makes sense.

The function signature looks like this: `std::min(values: set of anytype) -> optional anytype`."}, {"human": "So how would I use it with a set of integers, for example?", "assistant": "You would pass the set of integers to the `min()` function like this: `select min({your_integer_set_here});`. For instance, if you want to find the minimum of -1 and 100, you would write: `select min({-1, 100});`."}, {"human": "Got it. And what would be the result of that example?", "assistant": "The result would be the smallest number in the set, which is `-1`. So, when you run `select min({-1, 100});` in the EdgeDB REPL, you'll get: `{-1}`."}, {"human": "What if the set is empty? What does min() return then?", "assistant": "If the set is empty, `min()` will return `None` since there are no values to compare. The result is an optional type, meaning it can be the type of the elements in the set or `None` if the set is empty."}, {"human": "Makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to get the largest value from a set of numbers in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `max()` function to find the largest value in a set. The syntax looks like this: `std::max(values: set of anytype) -> optional anytype`. It returns the largest value from the given set."}, {"human": "Great! Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's a simple example where we select the maximum value from a set of integers: \n```edgeql\nselect std::max({-1, 100});\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return `{100}` as the result, since 100 is the largest number in the set."}, {"human": "What happens if I use it with an empty set?", "assistant": "If you use `max()` with an empty set, it will return `None` because there are no values to compare. Here's how you would write the query for an empty set: \n```edgeql\nselect std::max({});\n```\nAnd the result of this query would be `{}` since there's no value to return."}, {"human": "Got it. And this works with any type of values, not just integers?", "assistant": "Yes, that's correct. The `max()` function can be used with any type of values as long as they can be compared. For example, you can use it with strings to find the maximum value alphabetically. Just keep in mind that all values in the set should be of the same or compatible types."}, {"human": "Makes sense. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how the 'union' operator works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the 'union' operator is used to merge two sets together. It's important to note that sets in EdgeDB are actually multisets, which means they can contain duplicate elements. When you use 'union', it combines all elements from both sets, including duplicates. For instance, if you have two sets `{1, 2, 2}` and `{2}`, and you apply `union` to them, the result will be `{1, 2, 2, 2}`. Would you like to see an example in EdgeQL?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say we have two sets of numbers and we want to merge them using the 'union' operator. Here's how you would write that in EdgeQL: ```eql WITH set1 := {1, 2, 2}, set2 := {2} SELECT set1 union set2; ``` This query will output `{1, 2, 2, 2}`, because it combines all the elements from `set1` and `set2`. Does that make sense?"}, {"human": "Got it, thanks! So 'union' keeps all duplicates. What if I want to combine sets but only keep unique elements?", "assistant": "If you want to combine sets but only keep unique elements, you can use the 'distinct' function in combination with 'union'. Here's an example: ```eql WITH set1 := {1, 2, 2}, set2 := {2} SELECT distinct(set1 union set2); ``` This will give you `{1, 2}` as the result, because 'distinct' removes the duplicate `2` from the merged set. Remember that 'distinct' can be used to remove duplicates from any set, not just the result of a 'union'."}, {"human": "That's really helpful.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to get the common elements from two sets in EdgeQL. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeQL, you can use the `intersect` operator to find the common elements between two sets. The syntax looks like this: `set of anytype intersect set of anytype -> set of anytype`."}, {"human": "Okay, but what does `anytype` mean in this context?", "assistant": "`anytype` is a placeholder for the actual data type of the items in your sets. For example, if you're working with sets of integers, `anytype` would be `int`.

Here's how you would write the query:\n```eql\nSELECT {1, 2, 3, 4} intersect {3, 4, 5, 6};\n```\nThis query would return a set containing the numbers `{3, 4}`, since those are the common elements in both sets."}, {"human": "What if I want to ensure the result is distinct? I noticed the note in the documentation about ordering.", "assistant": "Good observation! The order of the elements in the result of an `intersect` operation is not guaranteed.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the 'except' operator in EdgeQL. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'except' operator in EdgeQL is used to produce a set of elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set. It's similar to the set difference operation in mathematics.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the 'like' operator in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! The 'like' operator in EdgeDB is used for case-sensitive simple string matching. It returns `true` if the string value on the left matches the pattern on the right. For example, if you want to check if a title contains the word 'Star', you could use `title like '%Star%'`. The percent signs `%` are used as wildcards that match any sequence of characters."}, {"human": "Got it. So how would I use it in an actual EdgeQL query?", "assistant": "Sure, let's say you have a `Movie` type and you want to find all movies with titles that contain 'Star'. Your EdgeQL query would look something like this:\n```eql\nSELECT Movie\nWHERE Movie.title like '%Star%';\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to find movies that do not contain 'Star' in the title?", "assistant": "In that case, you would use the `not like` operator, which is the negation of `like`. Here's how you would write the query:\n```eql\nSELECT Movie\nWHERE Movie.title not like '%Star%';\n```"}, {"human": "Is there anything special about the patterns I should know about?", "assistant": "Yes, the patterns used with `like` can include wildcard characters. The `%` symbol matches any sequence of characters, and the `_` symbol matches any single character. For example, `'%a%'` matches any string containing 'a', and `'a_%_%'` matches any string that starts with 'a' and has at least two more characters."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to do case-insensitive string matching in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `ilike` operator for case-insensitive string matching. It works similarly to the `like` operator but ignores the case of the characters when matching the pattern."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use `ilike`?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a string 'Abc' and you want to check if it matches the pattern 'a%'. You can use the `ilike` operator like this:\n```edgeql\nselect 'Abc' ilike 'a%';\n```\nThis query will return `{true}` because 'Abc' does start with 'a', regardless of the case."}, {"human": "What if I want to check for a non-match?", "assistant": "For that, you can use the `not ilike` operator. It's the negation of `ilike` and returns `true` if the pattern does not match. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect 'Abc' not ilike 'x%';\n```\nThis will return `{true}` because 'Abc' does not start with 'x'."}, {"human": "Got it! So it's pretty straightforward. Is there anything else I should know about using `ilike`?", "assistant": "Just remember that the pattern you use with `ilike` can include the standard SQL wildcard characters, such as `%` for matching any sequence of characters and `_` for matching any single character. Other than that, you're all set to use `ilike` for case-insensitive pattern matching in EdgeDB!"}]}

If you have a string 'Some Fancy Title' and you want to convert it to lowercase, you would use the function like this in an EdgeQL query:\n```edgeql\nselect std::str_lower('Some Fancy Title');\n```\nAnd the result would be:\n```\n{'some fancy title'}\n```"}, {"human": "That looks simple enough. So I just wrap my string with `std::str_lower()` and it will do the job?", "assistant": "Exactly! Just pass the string you want to convert as an argument to `std::str_lower()` and it will return the lowercase version of that string."}, {"human": "Can I use this function in a query that fetches data from the database?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use `std::str_lower()` in any EdgeQL query where you need to transform a string to lowercase. For example, if you have a `Movie` type with a `title` property, you can get all movie titles in lowercase like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Movie {\n  title_lower := std::str_lower(.title)\n};\n```"}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks!

How do I use it in a query?", "assistant": "You can use `str_title()` in an EdgeQL query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect str_title('sOmE fAnCy TiTlE');\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return the string 'Some Fancy Title'."}, {"human": "Great, let me try that. And what if I want to apply this to a field in my database, say, a book title?", "assistant": "If you have a field that you want to convert to title case, you can apply `str_title()` directly to that field in your query. For example, if you have a `Book` type with a `title` field, you could write:\n```edgeql\nselect Book {\n  title_in_titlecase := str_title(.title)\n};\n```\nThis will return the titles of all books in title case."}, {"human": "That's perfect.

This function pads the input string at the start to a specified length. If the string is already longer than the desired length, it will be truncated."}, {"human": "Sounds useful! How exactly do I use it?", "assistant": "You can use `std::str_pad_start()` by passing the string you want to pad as the first argument, the total desired length as the second argument, and optionally, the character you want to use for padding as the third argument. If you don't specify a padding character, it defaults to a space.

In EdgeDB, you can use the `to_str()` function to convert various data types to strings. This function can handle types like `datetime`, `duration`, `int64`, `float64`, `bigint`, and `decimal`. You can also provide an optional format string if needed. Would you like to see some examples?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of how to convert a datetime to a string.", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you can convert a `datetime` value to a string using the `to_str()` function in EdgeQL:\n```eql\nSELECT std::to_str(<datetime>'2023-04-01T12:34:56+00:00');\n```\nThis will convert the `datetime` value to its default string representation. If you want to specify a custom format, you can pass a format string as the second argument."}, {"human": "What about converting an integer? How would that work?", "assistant": "Converting an integer to a string is quite straightforward. Here's an example using the `int64` type:\n```eql\nSELECT std::to_str(<int64>123456);\n```\nThis will convert the integer `123456` to the string `'123456'`. If you need to format the integer in a specific way, you can provide a format string as well."}, {"human": "Can you convert a float to a string with a specific format?", "assistant": "Certainly! When converting a `float64` to a string, you can use a format string to specify the precision or format you want. For example:\n```eql\nSELECT std::to_str(<float64>123.456, '%.2f');\n```\nThis will convert the float `123.456` to a string with two decimal places: `'123.46'`."}, {"human": "I also have some big integers and decimals. How do I handle those?", "assistant": "For `bigint` and `decimal` types, the process is the same as with other numeric types. Here's how you can convert them:\n```eql\n-- For bigint\nSELECT std::to_str(<bigint>12345678901234567890);\n\n-- For decimal\nSELECT std::to_str(<decimal>12345.67890);\n```\nBoth will be converted to their string representations. If you have a specific format in mind, just include the format string as the second argument to `to_str()`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to format dates and times in EdgeDB and I'm not sure how to use the different patterns. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! EdgeDB provides several patterns for formatting dates and times. Each pattern corresponds to a specific part of the date or time. For example, 'HH' is used to represent the hour of the day in a 12-hour format, ranging from 01 to 12."}, {"human": "What if I want to use a 24-hour format?", "assistant": "If you prefer a 24-hour format, you can use 'HH24' instead of 'HH'. This will display the hour of the day ranging from 00 to 23."}, {"human": "And how about minutes and seconds?", "assistant": "For minutes, you use 'MI', which will give you the minute within the hour from 00 to 59. For seconds, it's 'SS', which also ranges from 00 to 59."}, {"human": "What if I need to show milliseconds or microseconds?", "assistant": "For milliseconds, you can use 'MS', which displays the millisecond part of the time ranging from 000 to 999. For microseconds, the pattern is 'US', and it will display values from 000000 to 999999."}, {"human": "Is there a way to show the total number of seconds past midnight?", "assistant": "Yes, there is. You can use 'SSSS' to represent the number of seconds that have passed since midnight, which can be anywhere from 0 to 86399."}, {"human": "Sometimes I need to indicate whether it's AM or PM. How can I do that?", "assistant": "To indicate the meridiem, you can use 'AM', 'am', 'PM', or 'pm'. This will add the appropriate meridiem indicator to the time."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what a 'str' type is in EdgeDB. Can you explain?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `str` is a type that represents a Unicode string of text. It's used to store textual data."}, {"human": "So, can I convert other types to a string?", "assistant": "Yes, you can cast almost any other type to and from a string in EdgeDB. For example, you can cast an integer to a string or a string to a boolean."}, {"human": "How would I do that in EdgeQL?", "assistant": "You can use the `select` statement in EdgeQL to cast types. Here are a few examples:\n\n```edgeql\nselect 42; # This will return {'42'} as a string\nselect 'true'; # This will return {true} as a boolean\nselect \"I \u2764\ufe0f EdgeDB\"; # This will return {'I \u2764\ufe0f EdgeDB'} as a string\n```"}, {"human": "What happens when I cast a string to JSON?", "assistant": "When you cast a `str` to `json` in EdgeDB, the result is a JSON string value. The same principle applies when casting back from `json` to `str`."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of casting a string to JSON?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's how you would cast a string to JSON in EdgeQL:\n\n```edgeql\nselect <json>'{\"key\": \"value\"}'; # This will return a JSON object with a key-value pair\n```"}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or EdgeQL, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how string indexing works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, you can access characters in a string by their index using the `str[i]` operator. Indexing starts at 0, so the first character has an index of 0, the second character has an index of 1, and so on. You can also use negative indexes to start counting from the end of the string, where `-1` is the last character, `-2` is the second to last, and so forth."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use this?", "assistant": "Absolutely! Let's say you have the string 'some text' and you want to select the second character. You would use the following EdgeQL query: ```edgeql SELECT 'some text'[1];``` This query would return the character 'o', since indexing starts at 0. If you wanted to select the last character of the string, you could use a negative index like this: ```edgeql SELECT 'some text'[-1];``` This would return the character 't'."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to access an index that's outside the string length?", "assistant": "Attempting to access an index outside the bounds of the string will result in an error. For example, if you try to access the index 10 in the string 'some text', which only has 9 characters, EdgeDB will throw an error because there is no character at that index."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how string slicing works in EdgeQL. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Sure! String slicing in EdgeQL allows you to extract a substring from a string by specifying a start and an end index. Indexing starts at 0, and you can also use negative indexes to start from the end of the string. Here's the syntax: `str[from:to]`."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example?", "assistant": "Of course! Let's say you have the string 'some text' and you want to get the substring from index 1 to index 3. You would write the query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect 'some text'[1:3];\n```\nThe result would be:\n```\n{'om'}\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to get the last 4 characters of the string?", "assistant": "To get the last 4 characters, you can use a negative index for the start position. Here's how you do it:\n```edgeql\nselect 'some text'[-4:];\n```\nThe result will be the substring starting from the fourth last character to the end of the string:\n```\n{'text'}\n```"}, {"human": "And what if I only know that I want to skip the last 5 characters?", "assistant": "If you want to skip the last 5 characters, you can use a negative index in the end position. Here's the query for that:\n```edgeql\nselect 'some text'[:-5];\n```\nThis will give you the substring from the beginning of the string up to (but not including) the fifth last character:\n```\n{'some'}\n```"}, {"human": "Is it possible to start and end the slice with negative indexes?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use negative indexes for both the start and end of the slice. For example, to get the substring from the fifth last to the second last character, you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect 'some text'[5:-2];\n```\nThe result would be:\n```\n{'te'}\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to concatenate two strings in EdgeDB. Can you show me how to do that?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, you can concatenate two strings using the '++' operator. Here's how you can do it in an EdgeQL query:"}, {"human": "Okay, can you give me an example?", "assistant": "Certainly! If you want to concatenate the strings 'Hello' and 'World', you would write the query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect 'Hello' ++ ' World';\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return the concatenated string 'Hello World'."}, {"human": "Great, that looks simple enough. What if I want to concatenate a string with a space in between?", "assistant": "To include a space, you simply add the space within the quotes of one of the strings. For example:\n```edgeql\nselect 'Hello' ++ ' ' ++ 'World';\n```\nThis will return 'Hello World' with a space between the two words."}, {"human": "Got it. And this will work with any strings, right?", "assistant": "Yes, it will work with any strings. Just remember to use the '++' operator for concatenation. Here's another example concatenating 'Edge' and 'DB':\n```edgeql\nselect 'Edge' ++ 'DB';\n```\nThis will return 'EdgeDB'."}, {"human": "Perfect, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome!

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to check the version of the EdgeDB server I'm running. Is there a way to do that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can use the `sys::get_version()` function in EdgeQL to retrieve the server version. It returns the version as a tuple with several elements."}, {"human": "What are the elements that the tuple contains?", "assistant": "The tuple contains the `major` and `minor` elements, which represent the major and minor components of the version. It also includes a `stage` element, which is an enumeration value that can be one of `'dev'`, `'alpha'`, `'beta'`, `'rc'`, or `'final'`. Lastly, there's a `stage_no`, which is the stage sequence number."}, {"human": "Can you show me how to use this function in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Here's a simple EdgeQL query that calls the `sys::get_version()` function:\n```eql\nSELECT sys::get_version();\n```"}, {"human": "What will the output look like?", "assistant": "The output will be a tuple with the version information. For example, it might look something like this:\n```eql\n(\n    major := 1,\n    minor := 0,\n    stage := 'final',\n    stage_no := 0\n)\n```This indicates that the server version is 1.0 and it's a final release."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to check the version of my EdgeDB server. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! You can check the version of your EdgeDB server by using the `sys::get_version_as_str()` function. This function returns the server version as a string."}, {"human": "Great! How do I use it?", "assistant": "You can use it in an EdgeQL query. Here's an example of how to use it in the EdgeDB REPL:\n```edgeql\nSELECT sys::get_version_as_str();\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return the version of the server, like '1.0-alpha.1'."}, {"human": "Do I need to import anything before I can use this function?", "assistant": "No, you don't need to import anything. The `sys::get_version_as_str()` function is part of the system module, which is automatically available in EdgeDB. You can use it directly in your query."}, {"human": "What will the output look like?", "assistant": "The output will be a JSON object with the version of the EdgeDB server as a string.

However, if you're using the EdgeDB CLI, you can also check the version of the server by running the command `edgedb server info` in your terminal."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how transactions work in EdgeDB. Can you explain how I can check the isolation level of a transaction?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, you can check the isolation level of the current transaction by using the `sys::get_transaction_isolation()` function. This function returns the isolation level as defined by the `sys::TransactionIsolation` enum."}, {"human": "Okay, that sounds useful. How do I actually use this function in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You can use this function within an EdgeQL query. Here's an example of how to select the isolation level of the current transaction:\n```edgeql\nselect sys::get_transaction_isolation();\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return the isolation level, such as `{sys::TransactionIsolation.Serializable}`."}, {"human": "Got it. So what are the possible values that this function can return?", "assistant": "The `sys::get_transaction_isolation()` function will return a value that is a member of the `sys::TransactionIsolation` enum. The exact values that are possible depend on the EdgeDB version and its supported transaction isolation levels. In the example provided, `Serializable` is one of the isolation levels that can be returned."}, {"human": "Is there a way to set the transaction isolation level, or is it fixed?", "assistant": "The documentation snippet provided doesn't include information on setting the transaction isolation level, only on retrieving it. However, typically, database systems do allow you to set the isolation level at the start of a transaction. For specific instructions on how to do this in EdgeDB, you would need to refer to the relevant section of the EdgeDB documentation or other resources."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to get the name of the database I'm currently using in EdgeDB. Is there a simple way to do that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `sys::get_current_database()` function to retrieve the name of the current database. It returns the name as a string."}, {"human": "Oh, that sounds handy. How exactly do I use it?", "assistant": "It's quite straightforward. You can use it in an EdgeQL query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect sys::get_current_database();\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return the name of the database you're connected to."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of what the output would look like?", "assistant": "Sure!

If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what TransactionIsolation is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `TransactionIsolation` is an enum type that indicates the possible transaction isolation modes. It's used to specify the level of isolation you want for a transaction in the database."}, {"human": "So what are the possible values for TransactionIsolation?", "assistant": "Currently, the `TransactionIsolation` enum only accepts a single value, which is `Serializable`. This is the strictest level of isolation, ensuring that transactions are completely isolated from each other."}, {"human": "How would I use TransactionIsolation in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You would use `TransactionIsolation` when you start a transaction and want to set its isolation level. However, since EdgeDB currently only supports the `Serializable` isolation level, you don't need to explicitly set it, as it's the default behavior."}, {"human": "Got it.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to construct tuples in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can create a tuple by enclosing a sequence of comma-separated expressions in parentheses. For example, to create a simple tuple, you would write it like this: `(expression1, expression2, ...)`. Would you like to see a concrete example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of a simple tuple.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's an example of a simple tuple with two elements: ```edgeql (123, 'abc') ``` This tuple contains an integer and a string. The first element is the number 123, and the second is the string 'abc'."}, {"human": "Got it. And what about named tuples? How do those work?", "assistant": "Named tuples are similar to simple tuples, but each element has a name associated with it. To declare a named tuple, you use the following syntax: ```edgeql (name1 := expression1, name2 := expression2, ...) ``` Remember that all elements in a named tuple must have a name. Would you like to see an example of a named tuple?"}, {"human": "Yes, an example would be great.", "assistant": "Alright, here's an example of a named tuple: ```edgeql (first_name := 'John', age := 30) ``` In this named tuple, `first_name` is associated with the string 'John', and `age` is associated with the integer 30."}, {"human": "That makes sense.

And how would I access elements in a named tuple?", "assistant": "For a named tuple, you would use the name of the element instead of an index. Here's an example: \n```edgeql\nselect (number := 1, name := 'EdgeDB').name;\n```\nThis query will return `{'EdgeDB'}` because it selects the element named `name` from the tuple."}, {"human": "That makes sense. Can I mix named and unnamed elements in a tuple?", "assistant": "No, a tuple should be either entirely named or entirely unnamed.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how tuples work in EdgeDB. Can you explain nesting tuples to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, tuples can contain other tuples, which is what we call nesting. For example, you can have a tuple like `(1, 2)` and nest it inside another tuple. Here's how you can select the first element of a nested tuple:"}, {"human": "Could you show me an example of how to do that?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's an EdgeQL query that demonstrates selecting the first element of a nested tuple:\n```edgeql\nselect (nested_tuple := (1, 2)).nested_tuple.0;\n```\nWhen you run this query, it will return `{1}`, which is the first element of the nested tuple `(1, 2)`."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to access an element that doesn't exist in the tuple?", "assistant": "If you try to reference a tuple element that doesn't exist, EdgeDB will raise an error. For instance, if you have a tuple `(1, 2)` and you try to access the fifth element, you'll get an error because the tuple only has two elements. Here's what the error looks like:\n```edgeql\nselect (1, 2).5;\n```\nAnd the error message you'll receive is: `EdgeQLError: 5 is not a member of a tuple`."}, {"human": "Got it, that makes sense. So I always need to make sure the element I'm accessing exists. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "Exactly! Always ensure that the element you're trying to access is within the bounds of the tuple.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what a tuple is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a tuple is a heterogeneous sequence of other types. This means it can contain elements of different types. For example, you can have a tuple containing a string and an integer."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to create a tuple?", "assistant": "Sure! You can create a tuple by using a tuple constructor. Here's a simple example where we select a tuple with a string and an integer:\n```edgeql\nSELECT ('foo', 42);\n```"}, {"human": "What does it mean when you say a tuple is 'heterogeneous'?", "assistant": "Heterogeneous means that the elements within the tuple can be of different types. Unlike an array where all elements are of the same type, a tuple can have a mix of types like strings, integers, or even other complex types."}, {"human": "Can tuple elements have names?", "assistant": "Yes, tuple elements can optionally have names. When they do, we refer to it as a _named tuple_. Named tuples are useful for accessing elements by name rather than by position."}, {"human": "How do I create a named tuple?", "assistant": "You create a named tuple by specifying names for the elements.

{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand the type union operator in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, the type union operator is denoted by a vertical bar `|`. It's used to create a union of types, which means it refers to any value that is of either type on either side of the operator.

You can chain the type union operator to create a union of as many types as you need. For example:\n```eql\nselect entity is Person | Robot | Alien;\n```This query checks if `entity` is a `Person`, `Robot`, or `Alien`."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand type casting in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Sure! In EdgeDB, type casting is an operation that allows you to convert a value from one type to another. It's done using the type cast operator, which is denoted by a '<type>' followed by the value you want to cast. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of how to use the type cast operator.", "assistant": "Alright, let's say you have a string '123' and you want to cast it to an integer. You would use the type cast operator like this:\n```eql\nSELECT <int64>'123';\n```\nThis will convert the string '123' to the integer 123. The type you're casting to must be a valid non-abstract scalar or a container type, and the operation is performed at run-time."}, {"human": "What happens if the cast fails? Does it throw an error?", "assistant": "Yes, if the cast cannot be performed, EdgeDB will throw a run-time error. For example, if you try to cast a string that doesn't represent a valid number to an integer, like this:\n```eql\nSELECT <int64>'abc';\n```\nYou'll get an error because 'abc' is not a valid integer."}, {"human": "Got it. Can I also cast to container types like arrays?", "assistant": "Certainly! You can cast to container types such as arrays. For instance, if you want to cast a set of integers to an array of integers, you could do something like this:\n```eql\nSELECT <array<int64>>{1, 2, 3};\n```\nThis will create an array of integers containing [1, 2, 3]."}, {"human": "Thanks, that makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about type casting?", "assistant": "You're welcome! Just remember that type casting is a powerful tool, but you should use it judiciously.

You can use the 'typeof' operator like this:\n```eql\ntypeof x -> type\n```This will return the type of 'x'."}, {"human": "Does 'typeof' work with collections, like arrays or sets?", "assistant": "No, currently the 'typeof' operator does not support collections as a valid operand. It only supports scalars and objects. So you can't use 'typeof' directly on an array or set to get its type."}, {"human": "Okay, got it. So how would I use 'typeof' with the 'is' operator?", "assistant": "You can use 'typeof' with the 'is' operator to check if a certain expression is of a specific type. For example:\n```eql\nSELECT (typeof x) is std::int64;\n```\nThis query will return true if the type of 'x' is 'std::int64'."}, {"human": "And what about using 'typeof' with 'introspect'?", "assistant": "When you use 'typeof' with 'introspect', you can get detailed information about the type of an expression. Here's how you might use it:\n```eql\nSELECT introspect (typeof x);\n```\nThis will return a description of the type of 'x', including its properties and links if 'x' is an object type."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what the 'introspect type' operator does in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! The 'introspect type' operator is used for static type introspection in EdgeDB. It allows you to retrieve information about a type's definition within the schema. When you use this operator, it returns the introspection type corresponding to the type you provide as an operand."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you want to get information about a scalar type like 'str'. You would use the 'introspect type' operator like this:\n```eql\nintrospect type -> str\n```\nThis query will return the introspection type for the 'str' scalar type."}, {"human": "What about using it with the 'typeof' operator?", "assistant": "The 'typeof' operator can be used to get the type of a given expression, and you can combine it with 'introspect type' to introspect the type of that expression. For example:\n```eql\nSELECT introspect type -> typeof('Hello, World!')\n```\nThis will introspect the type of the string 'Hello, World!', which is 'str'."}, {"human": "Are there any limitations to the 'introspect' operator?", "assistant": "Yes, currently the 'introspect' operator supports scalar types and object types, but it does not support collection types. So you can use it to introspect individual scalar and object types, but not arrays, tuples, or other collection types."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what a UUID is in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! A UUID, which stands for Universally Unique Identifier, is a standardized way of ensuring that identifiers are unique across different systems. EdgeDB uses UUIDs to uniquely identify objects. According to formal definitions, you can refer to RFC 4122 and ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005 for more details."}, {"human": "So every object in EdgeDB has a UUID?", "assistant": "Yes, that's correct. Every object in EdgeDB has a globally unique property called `id` which is represented by a UUID value. This ensures that every object can be uniquely identified within the database."}, {"human": "Can you show me how a UUID is used in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "Sure! When you define an object type in EdgeDB, it automatically has a UUID `id` property. For example, if you have a type `User`, you can select its UUID like this:\n```edgeql\nSELECT User {\n  id\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What if I have a UUID and I want to get the object it represents?", "assistant": "If you have a UUID and you want to find the object it corresponds to, you can cast the UUID to the object type. For example, if you have a UUID and you want to get the `User` object with that ID, you can do the following:\n```edgeql\nSELECT User\nFILTER .id = <uuid>'01d9cc22-b776-11ed-8b77-2f4d54e6ad2c';\n```"}, {"human": "Is there a way to generate a new UUID in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "EdgeDB itself doesn't provide a function to generate UUIDs because they are usually generated by the client application. However, when you insert a new object into the database, EdgeDB will automatically generate a unique UUID for its `id` property."}, {"human": "Got it. And I assume that UUIDs are used for relations between objects as well?", "assistant": "Exactly! UUIDs are used to establish relations between objects. For instance, if you have a `Book` type and an `Author` type, you might define a link from `Book` to `Author` using the UUIDs. Here's a simple example:\n```sdl\ntype Author {\n  required name: str;\n}\n\ntype Book {\n  required title: str;\n  author: Author;\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Thanks, that makes sense. I appreciate your help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or UUIDs, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to generate unique identifiers for my database records, and I heard that UUIDs are a good choice. Can EdgeDB help with that?", "assistant": "Absolutely! EdgeDB provides a function called `std::uuid_generate_v1mc()` that returns a version 1 UUID. This function generates a UUID using a random multicast MAC address, which includes 47 random bits, 60 bits for the current time, and 14 bits for the clock sequence to ensure uniqueness."}, {"human": "Sounds good, but why would I use a multicast MAC address instead of the real MAC address?", "assistant": "Using a multicast MAC address helps to maintain privacy and security, as it doesn't expose the real MAC address of your computer. This is particularly useful when you want to avoid potential tracking or identification of the machine where the UUIDs are generated."}, {"human": "I see. How do I use this function in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "You can use the `std::uuid_generate_v1mc()` function in your EdgeQL queries. Here's a simple example of how to generate a UUID and use it in an INSERT statement:\n```eql\nINSERT MyRecord {\n  id := std::uuid_generate_v1mc()\n};\n```"}, {"human": "Great, that looks straightforward. Is there anything else I should know about using UUIDs in EdgeDB?", "assistant": "When using UUIDs, it's important to ensure that the field you're storing the UUID in is of type `uuid`. In your schema definition, you would define it like this:\n```sdl\ntype MyRecord {\n  required id: uuid;\n}\n```Remember to use the `required` constraint if you want to make sure every record has a unique identifier."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to generate UUIDs in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can generate a version 4 UUID using the `std::uuid_generate_v4()` function. This function returns a UUID that is derived entirely from random numbers."}, {"human": "So, what exactly is a version 4 UUID?", "assistant": "A version 4 UUID contains 122 random bits and 6 version bits, making it highly unique. It's generated randomly, which means that each time you call the function, you'll get a different UUID."}, {"human": "Can I use this function to set a default value for an `id` property in my schema?", "assistant": "Yes, you can. It's common to use `std::uuid_generate_v4()` to override the default value of the `id` property in your schema. Here's how you can do it in SDL:"}, {"human": "Could you show me an example of how to set it up?", "assistant": "Sure, here's a simple SDL example where we set the default value of the `id` property to a UUID generated by `std::uuid_generate_v4()`:\n```\nsdl\ntype User {\n  required id -> uuid {\n    default := std::uuid_generate_v4()\n  }\n  # ... other properties ...\n}\n```"}, {"human": "Looks straightforward. But you mentioned I should use this with caution. Why is that?", "assistant": "While using fully random UUIDs as default `id` values is generally safe, it's important to be cautious because they are not predictable and can't be easily guessed. This is usually a good thing for security, but it can have implications for performance in certain database operations, like indexing. So, it's just something to be aware of when designing your schema."}, {"human": "Got it, thanks for the heads up! I'll keep that in mind.", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
