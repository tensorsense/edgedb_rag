# Synthetic Data Generation

In order to finetune a GPT-3.5 model, you need to generate training data in a specific format.

Here you can find a notebook that generates QA conversations from official EdgeDB documentation about EdgeQL and SDL.

Along with it, there's a sample dataset of ~650 samples that can be used to run fine-tuning.
