{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to add a new movie to our database using EdgeDB, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! To insert a new movie into your database, you can use the EdgeQL INSERT statement. Here's an example of how you can add a movie titled 'The Marvels':"}, {"human": "Great, can you show me the code?", "assistant": "Certainly! Here's the EdgeQL code snippet you can use:\n```edgeql\nwith new_movie := (insert Movie { title := 'The Marvels' })\nselect new_movie {\n  id,\n  title\n};\n```"}, {"human": "What does this code do exactly?", "assistant": "This code does two things. First, it creates a new movie record with the title 'The Marvels' using the `insert` statement. Then, it immediately selects the `id` and `title` of the newly created movie using the `select` statement. The `with` clause is used to bind the result of the insert to the `new_movie` variable, which is then used in the select statement."}, {"human": "I see. And how will I know if the movie was added successfully?", "assistant": "If the movie is added successfully, the `select` statement will output the `id` and `title` of the new movie. The `id` is a unique identifier automatically generated by EdgeDB for the new record. If there's an error during insertion, EdgeDB will return an error message instead."}, {"human": "Got it. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance with EdgeDB, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the bitwise left-shift in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can use the `bit_lshift()` function to perform a bitwise left-shift operation on integers. This function takes two arguments: the first is the integer value you want to shift, and the second is the number of bits you want to shift it by. The function returns the shifted integer value."}, {"human": "I see. Can you show me an example of how to use it?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have an integer `val` that you want to shift to the left by `n` bits. Here's how you would use the `bit_lshift()` function in EdgeQL:"}, {"human": "Okay, I'm ready for the example.", "assistant": "```eql\nSELECT std::bit_lshift(val := 4, n := 2);\n```This will shift the binary representation of `4` (which is `0100`) to the left by `2` bits, resulting in `10000`, which is `16` in decimal."}, {"human": "Got it. And this works for different integer sizes, right?", "assistant": "Exactly! The `bit_lshift()` function can be used with `int16`, `int32`, and `int64` types. Just make sure that the value you're shifting and the return type match. For example, if you're shifting an `int16`, the result will also be an `int16`."}, {"human": "What happens if I shift by a negative number or by more bits than the size of the integer?", "assistant": "Shifting by a negative number of bits is not allowed, and you should ensure that the number of bits you're shifting by is appropriate for the size of the integer. Shifting an integer by more bits than its size or by a negative number can lead to undefined behavior or errors."}, {"human": "Understood. Thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or EdgeQL, feel free to ask."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use the 'in' and 'not in' operators in EdgeQL. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeQL, the 'in' operator is used to check if a given element is a member of a given set. Similarly, 'not in' checks if an element is not a member of a set. These operators compare each element of the left operand against the right operand, which should be a set. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Let's say we have a set of movie titles and we want to check if a specific title is in that set. Here's how you could write that in EdgeQL:\n```eql\nSELECT 'The Matrix' in {'The Matrix', 'Inception', 'Interstellar'};\n```\nThis query will return `true` because 'The Matrix' is indeed in the set of titles provided. Conversely, if you want to check if 'Avatar' is not in the set, you would write:\n```eql\nSELECT 'Avatar' not in {'The Matrix', 'Inception', 'Interstellar'};\n```\nThis would return `true` as well, since 'Avatar' is not in the set."}, {"human": "What if I want to check a set against another set?", "assistant": "When you're checking set membership with another set, the 'in' operator will check each element of the left set to see if it's present in the right set. For example:\n```eql\nSELECT {'The Matrix', 'Avatar'} in {'The Matrix', 'Inception', 'Interstellar'};\n```\nThis will return a set of boolean values: `{true, false}` because 'The Matrix' is in the right set, but 'Avatar' is not."}, {"human": "Got it! And what happens if I use a single element on the left side against a set on the right side?", "assistant": "When you use a single element on the left side and a set on the right side, the 'in' operator will return a single boolean value indicating whether the element is present in the set. For instance:\n```eql\nSELECT 'Inception' in {'The Matrix', 'Inception', 'Interstellar'};\n```\nThis query will return `true` because 'Inception' is a member of the set on the right side."}, {"human": "Is there anything special I need to know when using these operators in a query with actual data from the database?", "assistant": "When using 'in' or 'not in' with actual data from the database, you'll typically be checking if a value from one field is present in a set of values obtained from another query or field. For example, if you have a database of movies and actors, and you want to find out if a particular actor is in a movie, you could write something like this:\n```eql\nSELECT Movie {\n  title,\n  actors: {\n    name\n  }\n} FILTER 'Keanu Reeves' in Movie.actors.name;\n```\nThis query filters the list of movies to only include those where 'Keanu Reeves' is in the set of actor names for the movie."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand the basics of EdgeDB. Can you tell me what a BaseObject is?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, `BaseObject` is the root object type from which all other object types inherit. It's an abstract type, meaning you can't create instances of `BaseObject` directly, but it provides common functionality to all objects in the database."}, {"human": "What kind of common functionality are we talking about?", "assistant": "The `BaseObject` type includes a universally unique object identifier, which is a `uuid` field named `id`. This `id` field is required for all objects, has a default value generated by the function `std::uuid_generate_v1mc()`, is read-only, and has a constraint to ensure its uniqueness across all objects."}, {"human": "Can you show me what the definition looks like in SDL?", "assistant": "Sure, here's how the `BaseObject` is defined using SDL (Schema Definition Language):\n```sdl\nabstract type std::BaseObject {\n    # Universally unique object identifier\n    required id: uuid {\n        default := (select std::uuid_generate_v1mc());\n        readonly := true;\n        constraint exclusive;\n    }\n    # Object type in the information schema.\n    ...\n}\n```"}, {"human": "I see, so every object I create in EdgeDB will have this `id` field automatically?", "assistant": "Exactly! Every object type you define in your schema will inherit from `BaseObject`, and thus will have this `id` field with all the properties we discussed. It ensures that every object can be uniquely identified in the database."}, {"human": "What does the '...' mean in the SDL definition?", "assistant": "The '...' in the SDL definition is a placeholder indicating that there may be additional properties or links defined within the `BaseObject` type. In the actual SDL, you would either see more specific properties and links or nothing if there are no additional elements defined."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what 'anycontiguous' means in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, 'anycontiguous' is an abstract base type that is used for all valid contiguous ranges. It's a scalar type that can be used with `float32`, `float64`, `decimal`, `datetime`, and `cal::local_datetime`. These types are considered contiguous because they represent a continuous sequence of values without gaps."}, {"human": "So, is 'anycontiguous' a type I can use directly in my schema?", "assistant": "No, 'anycontiguous' itself is an abstract type, which means you cannot use it directly to store data in your schema. Instead, you use one of the specific scalar types that inherit from 'anycontiguous', like `float32`, `float64`, `decimal`, `datetime`, or `cal::local_datetime`, depending on the kind of data you want to represent."}, {"human": "Got it. Can you show me an example of how I might define a range in my schema using one of these types?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you want to define a range of datetimes to represent an event duration. You could define a type in your schema like this:\n``sdl\ntype Event {\n  start: datetime;\n  end: datetime;\n}\n``\nThis defines an 'Event' type with a 'start' and 'end' datetime, which implicitly uses the 'anycontiguous' base type because 'datetime' is a contiguous scalar type."}, {"human": "That makes sense. And how would I query a range of values?", "assistant": "To query a range of values, you can use EdgeQL's range operators. For example, if you want to find events that are happening within a specific time frame, you could write a query like this:\n```eql\nSELECT Event\nFILTER .start >= <datetime>'2023-01-01T00:00:00' AND .end <= <datetime>'2023-01-02T00:00:00';\n```\nThis query selects events that start on or after January 1st, 2023, and end on or before January 2nd, 2023."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to introspect scalar types in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB, you can introspect scalar types by querying the `schema::ScalarType`. Would you like to see an example of how to do this?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, here's an EdgeQL query that introspects the `schema::ScalarType`:\n```edgeql\nwith module schema\nselect ScalarType {\n    name,\n    links: {\n        name\n    },\n    properties: {\n        name\n    }\n}\nfilter .name = 'schema::ScalarType';\n```\nThis query selects the name of the scalar type, along with its links and properties, and filters the results to only include the `schema::ScalarType`."}, {"human": "What if I want to see all scalar types, not just the 'schema::ScalarType'?", "assistant": "To see all scalar types, you can modify the query by removing the filter clause. Here's how you would do it:\n```edgeql\nwith module schema\nselect ScalarType {\n    name,\n    links: {\n        name\n    },\n    properties: {\n        name\n    }\n};\n```\nThis will give you a list of all scalar types along with their names, links, and properties."}, {"human": "Got it. And how can I find out which scalar types are enums?", "assistant": "To find out which scalar types are enums, you can add a filter to check for the `enum_values` property. Here's an example:\n```edgeql\nwith module schema\nselect ScalarType {\n    name,\n    enum_values\n}\nfilter .enum_values != <array<str>>{};\n```\nThis query will return all scalar types that have a non-empty array of `enum_values`, which indicates they are enums."}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! One last thing, how can I get the default value of a scalar type?", "assistant": "To get the default value of a scalar type, you can select the `default` property. Here's the query for that:\n```edgeql\nwith module schema\nselect ScalarType {\n    name,\n    default\n};\n```\nThis will return the names of the scalar types along with their default values, if any."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm trying to understand how EdgeDB computes the cardinality of functions and operators. Can you explain that to me?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the cardinality computation for functions and operators is based on the cardinality of their inputs. There are three types of cardinality transformations based on the type qualifier of each input: default element-wise, optional, and aggregate."}, {"human": "Can you break down each type for me?", "assistant": "Of course! For the default element-wise qualifier, if you have an input with cardinality N, the output will also have cardinality N. This means the function or operator will be invoked N times, once for each input element."}, {"human": "What about the optional qualifier?", "assistant": "When an input is marked as optional, and its cardinality is N, the output cardinality will be max(1, N). This ensures that the function or operator is invoked at least once, even if the input is empty (which would normally have a cardinality of 0)."}, {"human": "And the aggregate qualifier?", "assistant": "For an aggregate qualifier, no matter what the cardinality N of the input is, the output cardinality will be 1. This is because an aggregate function or operator combines all input elements into a single result."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how this works in practice?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say we have a function that takes a set of integers and doubles each one. If we have a set of three integers, the cardinality is 3, and since it's an element-wise operation, the function will be invoked three times, producing three results. Here's a simple EdgeQL example:\n```\nSELECT {1, 2, 3} * 2;\n```\nThis will output `{2, 4, 6}`, each number being doubled individually."}, {"human": "What if the set is empty?", "assistant": "If the set is empty and the operation is optional, the function or operator would still be invoked once. However, for an element-wise operation with an empty set, the function wouldn't be invoked at all, and the result would also be an empty set."}, {"human": "And for an aggregate operation on an empty set?", "assistant": "For an aggregate operation on an empty set, the function would be invoked once, and depending on the function, it might return a default value or null. For example, using the `count()` aggregate function on an empty set would return 0, since there are no elements to count."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how constraints work in EdgeDB. Can you explain them to me?", "assistant": "Of course! Constraints in EdgeDB are rules that you can apply to properties to enforce certain conditions. For example, you can ensure that a string property has a minimum length, a maximum length, is unique across all instances of a type, or even matches a regular expression pattern. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example with some constraints.", "assistant": "Sure thing! Here's an example of a `BlogPost` type with a `title` property that has several constraints applied to it:\n```sdl\ntype BlogPost {\n  title: str {\n    constraint exclusive; # ensures all blog post titles are unique\n    constraint min_len_value(8); # title must be at least 8 characters long\n    constraint max_len_value(30); # title must be no more than 30 characters long\n    constraint regexp(r'^[A-Za-z0-9]+$'); # title must only contain alphanumeric characters\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `title` property must be unique across all `BlogPost` instances, have a length between 8 and 30 characters, and only contain letters and numbers."}, {"human": "What happens if I try to create a BlogPost with a title that doesn't meet these constraints?", "assistant": "If you attempt to create a `BlogPost` with a title that violates any of these constraints, EdgeDB will raise an error and the creation of that `BlogPost` will be rejected. This ensures data integrity and that all `BlogPost` titles adhere to the rules you've defined."}, {"human": "Can I add constraints to existing properties or do they have to be defined when the property is first created?", "assistant": "You can add constraints to existing properties using a migration. When you modify your schema to include new constraints on a property, you'll need to create and apply a migration. This migration will check existing data to ensure it complies with the new constraints and will apply the constraints to the property for all future data."}, {"human": "Great, thanks for the help!", "assistant": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about literals in EdgeDB. Can you explain how they work?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, literals like `6` or `'hello world'` are considered singletons. This means that when you use a literal in a query, you're actually declaring a set with a single element of a given type."}, {"human": "So when I write a query with a literal, it's not just a single value?", "assistant": "Exactly. Even though you're writing a single value, EdgeDB treats it as a set containing that one value. That's why when you run a query with a literal, the result is printed inside braces, indicating it's a set."}, {"human": "Can you show me an example of how this looks in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! If you run a query like `select 6;` in EdgeDB, the output will be `{6}`. Similarly, if you run `select 'hello world';`, the output will be `{'hello world'}`. Here's how it would look in the EdgeDB REPL:\n```\nedgeql-repl db> select 6;\n{6}\ndb> select 'hello world';\n{'hello world'}\n```"}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So the braces are there to show that it's a set. Does this affect how I use literals in my queries?", "assistant": "Not really. You can use literals in your queries just as you would normally. The understanding that they are sets is more about how EdgeDB internally represents these values. For your queries, you can continue to use literals as you're used to."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I'm a bit confused about the 'typeof' operator in EdgeQL. Can you explain what it does?", "assistant": "Certainly! The `typeof` operator in EdgeQL is used for static type inference. It allows you to convert an expression into its corresponding type. This can be particularly useful when you want to check the type of an expression using `is`, `is not`, or when you want to introspect the type."}, {"human": "Can you give me an example of how to use `typeof`?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a variable `x` and you want to know its type. You can use the `typeof` operator like this: ```eql typeof x -> type ``` This will return the type of `x`. You can then use this type with other operators like `is` to check if `x` is of a certain type."}, {"human": "Does `typeof` work with collections as well?", "assistant": "No, currently the `typeof` operator does not support collections. It only supports scalars and objects. So you can use it to find out the type of a scalar value or an object, but not an array or a set."}, {"human": "Okay, got it. So if I have an object of type `User`, how would I check its type using `typeof`?", "assistant": "If you have an object, say a variable `user` of type `User`, you can check its type like this: ```eql SELECT typeof(user) -> type; ``` And if you want to check if `user` is indeed of type `User`, you could use: ```eql SELECT typeof(user) = 'User' -> bool; ``` This will return a boolean value indicating whether `user` is of type `User`."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how to use subqueries in EdgeDB with TypeScript. Can you help me with that?", "assistant": "Of course! In EdgeDB's TypeScript query builder, you don't need to use explicit `with` blocks like you might in plain EdgeQL. Instead, you can assign your subqueries to variables and then compose them as needed. The query builder will automatically convert your top-level query into an EdgeQL expression with the appropriate `with` blocks. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example of how to do that.", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have two subqueries, one to fetch some users and another to fetch their posts. Here's how you could write it in TypeScript using EdgeDB's query builder:\n```typescript\nimport { createClient } from 'edgedb';\n\nconst client = createClient();\n\nasync function fetchUsersAndPosts() {\n  const UserQuery = e.select(e.User, {\n    filter: e.op('=', e.User.active, true),\n    limit: 10\n  });\n\n  const PostsQuery = e.select(e.Post, {\n    filter: e.op('=', e.Post.author, e.User.id)\n  });\n\n  const result = await client.execute(\n    e.select(UserQuery, {\n      id: true,\n      name: true,\n      posts: PostsQuery\n    })\n  );\n\n  return result;\n}\n\nfetchUsersAndPosts().then(console.log);\n```\nIn this example, `UserQuery` and `PostsQuery` are subqueries that are composed in the final query. The query builder takes care of creating the necessary `with` blocks when the query is executed. Does that make sense?"}, {"human": "I think I get it now. So I just write my subqueries as variables and then put them together in my main query?", "assistant": "Exactly! You've got it. By assigning subqueries to variables, you can easily compose and reuse them in your main query. The EdgeDB query builder is smart enough to handle the conversion to EdgeQL for you, including the `with` blocks. This makes your TypeScript code cleaner and more maintainable. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to figure out how to paginate results in EdgeDB. Can you help?", "assistant": "Absolutely! In EdgeDB, you can use the `limit` and `offset` clauses to paginate your results. These are often used together with `order by` to ensure a consistent ordering across pagination queries."}, {"human": "Could you give me an example of how to use these clauses?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a list of villains and you want to get the third and fourth villains alphabetically. You would use a query like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Villain {\n  name\n}\norder by .name\noffset 2\nlimit 2;\n```"}, {"human": "What does the 'offset 2' part do?", "assistant": "The `offset 2` clause skips the first two results. So if you're paginating, it means you're starting from the third item. It's useful when you want to jump to a specific position in the list of results."}, {"human": "And what about 'limit 2'?", "assistant": "The `limit 2` clause specifies the maximum number of results to return. In this case, it limits the query to return just two villains after skipping the first two, effectively giving you the third and fourth villains in the ordered list."}, {"human": "Got it! So if I wanted the next two villains, would I just increase the offset?", "assistant": "Exactly! To get the next two villains, you would increase the offset by two. Your query would look like this:\n```edgeql\nselect Villain {\n  name\n}\norder by .name\noffset 4\nlimit 2;\n```This would skip the first four villains and give you the fifth and sixth ones."}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "Hey, I'm trying to implement full-text search in my EdgeDB project. Can you explain how the fts::search() function works?", "assistant": "Certainly! The `fts::search()` function in EdgeDB is used to perform full-text search on a target object. You can apply a search query to the specified object, and if a match is found, the function will return a result. Here's the basic syntax of the function:\n```eql\nfts::search(\n  object: anyobject,\n  query: str,\n  named only language: str = fts::Language.eng,\n  named only weights: optional array = {}\n) -> optional tuple\n```"}, {"human": "I see. Can you show me an example of how to use it in a query?", "assistant": "Sure! Let's say you have a type `Article` with a text field `content` and you want to search for articles that contain the word 'EdgeDB'. Here's how you might write that query:\n```eql\nSELECT Article {\n  title,\n  content\n} FILTER fts::search(Article.content, 'EdgeDB');\n```"}, {"human": "What if I want to search in multiple fields, like both the title and content?", "assistant": "To search in multiple fields, you can concatenate the fields into a single search string. Here's an example:\n```eql\nSELECT Article {\n  title,\n  content\n} FILTER fts::search(Article.title ++ ' ' ++ Article.content, 'EdgeDB');\n```"}, {"human": "Got it. And what about the language and weights parameters?", "assistant": "The `language` parameter allows you to specify the language for the search, which defaults to English (`fts::Language.eng`). The `weights` parameter is an optional array that you can use to give different weights to different parts of the search object. For example, if you want to give more weight to the title than the content, you might do something like this:\n```eql\nSELECT Article {\n  title,\n  content\n} FILTER fts::search(\n  object := Article.title ++ ' ' ++ Article.content,\n  query := 'EdgeDB',\n  weights := [2, 1]  # title has twice the weight of content\n);\n```"}, {"human": "That's really helpful, thanks! What does the function return exactly?", "assistant": "The `fts::search()` function returns an optional tuple. If a match is found, the tuple will contain information about the match, such as the relevance score. If no match is found, the function returns an empty set."}, {"human": "Is there a way to get only the articles with the highest relevance score?", "assistant": "Yes, you can order the results by the relevance score and limit the results to get only the top matches. Here's an example:\n```eql\nSELECT Article {\n  title,\n  content,\n  score := fts::search(Article.content, 'EdgeDB').score\n} ORDER BY .score DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```"}]}
{"message_pairs": [{"human": "I came across the term 'detached' in EdgeDB. Can you explain what it means?", "assistant": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the `detached` keyword is used to mark an expression as not belonging to any scope. It's a way to refer to a set of data in a context-independent manner. Would you like to see an example of how it's used in a query?"}, {"human": "Yes, please show me an example.", "assistant": "Sure, let's say you have a type `Person` and you want to select all persons who are not friends with anyone. You could write a query like this:\n```eql\nSELECT Person FILTER NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT Person.friends FILTER Person = DETACHED Person\n);\n```\nIn this query, `DETACHED Person` refers to the entire set of `Person` objects, detached from the current scope of the `Person.friends` subquery."}, {"human": "Oh, I see. So without 'detached', the query would be incorrect?", "assistant": "Exactly. Without `detached`, the subquery `SELECT Person.friends FILTER Person = Person` would be comparing each `Person` to themselves within the scope of their friends, which is not what we want. By using `detached`, we're specifying that we want to compare against the entire set of `Person` objects in the database, not just the scoped subset."}, {"human": "Got it, that makes sense.
