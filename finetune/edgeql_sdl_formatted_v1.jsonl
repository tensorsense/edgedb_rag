There are more steps involved in the resolution process when policies are actually defined. Do you want to continue with the next steps?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, please continue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize, but it seems that the rest of the resolution algorithm isn't included in the snippet of documentation provided.

So how exactly do these super constraints work in practice?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Super constraints work by using EdgeQL within access policies. You can write an EdgeQL expression that defines the condition that must be met for the write operation to be considered valid. If the condition is not met, the operation is undone.

However, typically, this means that there might be restrictions on referencing volatile functions or other database objects that are not directly related to the object type the constraint is defined on."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I see. So I should be careful when defining these super constraints to make sure they don't hit any Postgres limitations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly. It's important to be aware of the underlying database's capabilities and limitations when defining constraints.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm trying to understand how to use optional parameters in EdgeQL. Can you explain that to me?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! In EdgeQL, when you define a query parameter, it is `required` by default. This means that the query will fail if you don't provide a value for the parameter.

So, if you have a parameter that's supposed to be an integer, a boolean, or any other type, you can still make it optional by using `<optional type>`. Also, remember that when a parameter is optional and not provided, it behaves as if the filter condition using that parameter is not present at all.

In EdgeDB, literals like `6` or `'hello world'` are considered singletons. This means that they are shorthand for declaring a set that contains a single element of a given type."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So when I use a literal, it's actually creating a set?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly! Every value in EdgeDB is a set, even if it's a set with just one item, which we call a singleton. When you use a literal in a query, EdgeDB treats it as a singleton set. That's why when you select a literal, the output is shown inside braces."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you show me an example of how this looks in a query?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! If you were to run a query selecting the number 6, it would look like this in the EdgeDB REPL:\n```\nedgeql-repl db> select 6;\n{6}\n```\nAnd if you select the string 'hello world', it would be displayed as:\n```\nedgeql-repl db> select 'hello world';\n{'hello world'}\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, I see. So the braces indicate that it's a set. Does this affect how I write queries in any way?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For the most part, you can write queries as you normally would, and EdgeDB will handle the underlying set nature of values.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm a bit confused about how EdgeDB handles the absence of data. Can you explain it to me?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, the absence of data is represented by an empty set, rather than using `null` as in SQL databases. This approach eliminates the concept of `null` and its associated edge cases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, how does this work in practice? Can you give me an example?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's say you have a query that fetches the email addresses of all users. In SQL, if a user doesn't have an email address, the result might include `null`. In EdgeDB, if a user doesn't have an email address, that user simply wouldn't appear in the set of email addresses. If no users have email addresses, you'd get an empty set."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's the problem with having `null` values, though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The existence of `null` can be problematic because it's an edge case that affects all of SQL. It requires additional logic to handle `null` values, such as checking for `null` before performing operations, which can complicate the code and lead to potential errors."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does this mean that EdgeDB doesn't have any concept similar to `null` at all?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's correct. EdgeDB's design philosophy is to avoid `null` and its complications by using sets. An empty set in EdgeDB signifies that there is no data, which simplifies the handling of such cases."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm a bit confused about how modules work in EdgeDB. Can you explain what an 'active module' is?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, a module is a namespace that groups related schema objects, like types and functions. By default, the active module is `default`, which means you can reference any schema object within this module by its short name, such as `User` or `BlogPost`. If you want to reference objects in other modules, you need to use their fully-qualified names, like `default::Hero`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, if I have a type called `User` in the default module, how would I reference it in a query?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If `User` is in the default module, you can simply reference it by its short name in your query.

For example, if you have a `User` type in a module named `auth`, you would reference it like this:\n```\nSELECT auth::User;\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is there a way to change the active module so I don't have to use the fully-qualified name all the time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can change the active module using a `with` clause. This allows you to set a different module as active for the scope of a query. For example:\n```\nWITH MODULE auth\nSELECT User;\n```\nIn this query, `User` would refer to `auth::User` because we've set `auth` as the active module with the `with` clause."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That's handy! Does this mean I can use multiple modules in a single query?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely! You can reference objects from multiple modules in a single query by using their fully-qualified names. If you want to temporarily set a different module as active, you can use the `with` clause for that part of the query.

In EdgeDB, an alias is a way to create a new view of existing data. It's like a virtual type that you can define to present data in a different shape or form. For example, you can merge information from linked objects into a single flat structure. Would you like to see a simple example?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, please show me an example."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright, let's say you have a type `Review` that has links to an `author` and a `movie`. You want to create an alias that includes the author's name and the movie's title along with the existing properties of `Review`.

So, the properties `author_name` and `movie_title` are computed from the existing links. Do I need to do anything special to use this alias in a query?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, you don't need to do anything special. Once you've defined the alias in your schema, you can use it in your EdgeQL queries just like you would with any other type. For example, you could select reviews with the author's name and movie's title like this:\n```edgeql\nSELECT ReviewAlias {\n    body,\n    rating,\n    author_name,\n    movie_title\n}\n```This query will return the body and rating from the `Review` type, along with the computed `author_name` and `movie_title` from the `ReviewAlias`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it. And what if I want to filter the results based on the computed properties?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can filter on computed properties just like you would on regular properties.

In EdgeDB, the 'and' and 'or' operators require both operands to produce a result. This means that if one of the operands is an empty set `{}`, the expression won't produce a result. On the other hand, 'all()' and 'any()' functions handle empty sets differently."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you give me an example of how 'and' and 'or' work with empty sets?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's say you have a boolean expression like this: `SELECT User FILTER User.active AND {};`.

Are they different?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, they are different. For example, if you use `all()` like this: `SELECT User FILTER all(User.groups);`, it will return `true` for users with no groups (since it's not the case that any group is false), and `false` for users with one or more groups that evaluate to `false`. Conversely, `any()` will return `false` for users with no groups, and `true` if at least one group evaluates to `true`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I see, so 'all()' and 'any()' are more permissive with empty sets."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly! They are designed to handle empty sets in a way that's often more intuitive when dealing with collections that might be empty.

The `str_upper()` function is used to convert the title to uppercase.\n5. `cast_size := count(.actors)` creates another computed field `cast_size` that contains the number of actors in the movie.

So when you see `.title`, it means 'the title of the current movie being processed'. Similarly, `.actors` refers to 'the actors linked to the current movie'. It's a way to access properties and links of the type within the query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it, thanks!

Now, what about backlinks? How do they work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Backlinks are a way to query a link in reverse. For example, if you have a `Person` type that is linked to a `Movie` type through an `actors` link, you might want to find all movies a person has acted in. In EdgeDB, you can define a computed property on the `Person` type that represents this reverse link. The syntax for querying backlinks is special and allows you to traverse the relationship in the opposite direction.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hey, I'm trying to understand what abstract types are in EdgeDB. Can you explain?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! In EdgeDB, an abstract type is a kind of template for other object types. It's not meant to be instantiated on its own, but other non-abstract types can extend it.

Let's say you have different types of content like movies and TV shows, and they share some common properties, such as a title. You can create an abstract type called `Content` with a `title` property. Then, you can create non-abstract types like `Movie` and `TVShow` that extend `Content` and add their specific properties. Here's how it looks in SDL:\n``sdl\nabstract type Content {\n  required title: str;\n}\n\ntype Movie extending Content {\n  required release_year: int64;\n}\n\ntype TVShow extending Content {\n  required num_seasons: int64;\n}\n``"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, I see. And what about multiple inheritance? Is that possible?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, EdgeDB supports multiple inheritance. This means that a non-abstract type can extend more than one abstract type.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hey, I'm trying to understand how type casting works in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! In EdgeDB, you can convert a value from one type to another using a type cast expression. This is useful when you want to explicitly change the type of a value. For example, if you have an integer and you want to treat it as a string, you can cast it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, how do I actually do that? Is there a special syntax?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, there is a specific syntax for casting. You use the `<` symbol followed by the type you want to cast to. For instance, if you want to cast an integer to a string, you would write it like this in an EdgeQL query: `select <str>10;`. This will return the integer 10 as a string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it. Can you show me an example of how that would look in the EdgeDB REPL?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! In the EdgeDB REPL, you would enter the query like this:\n```\n db> select <str>10;\n```\nAnd the output would be the string \"10\".

The type you're casting to must be a valid type expression denoting a non-abstract scalar or a container type. So you can cast to basic types like integers, strings, or to arrays and tuples, but not to abstract types or object types."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That makes sense.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hey, I'm a bit confused about implicit casts in EdgeDB. Can you explain what they are?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Implicit casts in EdgeDB occur automatically when the type of a value doesn't match the expected type in an expression. This is mostly used for numeric types where there's no potential loss of information, such as casting from a less precise numeric type to a more precise one."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you give me an example of where an implicit cast might happen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Let's say you have an `int64` value and you're using it in a context where a `float64` is expected. EdgeDB will automatically cast the `int64` value to `float64` because there's no loss of information when converting from an integer to a floating-point number."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I see. So, does this mean I can mix `int64` and `float64` in calculations without worrying about the types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly! When you perform calculations that involve both `int64` and `float64` values, EdgeDB will handle the necessary casts for you. For example, if you add an `int64` value to a `float64` value, the result will be a `float64` without you having to explicitly cast the `int64` value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it. Are there any cases where implicit casts would not be supported?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, implicit casts are not supported when there's a risk of information loss. For example, casting from a `float64` to an `int64` could result in truncation of the decimal part, so EdgeDB won't perform such a cast implicitly. In cases where you need to convert between types that could result in information loss, you'd have to use explicit casting."}]}

Can you explain what it means when they say EdgeQL is a functional language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! In EdgeQL, being a functional language means that every expression you write is essentially a composition of queries. These queries can be either explicit or implicit. An explicit query is one that you write out, like a `select` statement. An implicit query is one that's inferred by the language based on the context, such as within a function or operator, or as part of a statement clause."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I see. Can you give me an example of an implicit query?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! An implicit query happens when the language assumes a `select` subquery based on the context of how you're using a function or operator. For example, if you have a function that expects a set of elements as an argument, and you pass it a single link property, EdgeQL will implicitly convert that link property into a set by assuming a `select` subquery around it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That's interesting. Could you show me a code snippet to illustrate this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course! Let's say you have a type `Person` with a multi link to `Movie` called `acted_in`.

EdgeQL understands that `acted_in` is a link property that refers to multiple `Movie` objects, so it automatically wraps it in a `select` to treat it as a set of `Movie` objects before counting."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it, that makes sense. So the language is doing some of the work for me behind the scenes. Thanks for the explanation!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly!

In the context of the 'for' loop, 'x' is guaranteed to be a non-empty singleton, which means it will always have exactly one value in each iteration.

They start and end with a dollar sign followed by zero or more characters (forming a 'tag'), and then another dollar sign. The tag must be the same at the beginning and the end of the string. Here's an example:\n```\nSELECT $$This is a dollar-quoted string without a tag$$;\n\nSELECT $tag$This is a dollar-quoted string with a 'tag'$tag$;\n```\n\nThese are especially useful for writing long strings or strings that contain quotes. Does that help clarify things?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It does, thanks! So if I have a string with both single and double quotes, I should use a dollar-quoted string?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly! Using a dollar-quoted string allows you to include both single and double quotes in your string without the need for escaping them.

The tag makes the start and end delimiters distinct, so there's no confusion about where the string starts and ends, even if dollar signs are used within the string content."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is there a limit to what I can use as a tag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The tag can be any sequence of alphanumeric characters, and it's case-sensitive. Just make sure that the tag you use does not appear within the string content itself. Otherwise, it would prematurely terminate the string. There's no limit to the length of the tag, but it's usually best to keep it short and relevant to the context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it. So if I have a string that contains $$, I should use a tag to avoid issues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly! If your string contains dollar signs, using a tag is a good practice.

In this case, we're filtering to include only persons older than 30."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What if I want to sort the results?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To sort the results, you can use the 'order by' clause. For example, if you want to sort the persons by their age in descending order, you would write:\n```edgeql\nselect Person\nfilter .age > 30\norder by .age desc;\n```You can add 'asc' for ascending order or 'desc' for descending order after the property you're sorting by. You can also chain sorting conditions using 'then'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can I limit the number of results returned?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can limit the number of results using the 'limit' clause.

However, there are certain operations that can cause you to lose this shape information, either completely or partially."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you give me an example of an operation that would cause shape loss?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! One common operation that can lead to losing shapes is the `union` operation. When you perform a union of two or more sets with different shapes, the resulting set may not preserve the original shapes of the individual sets. This is because the union operation combines the sets and needs to reconcile differences in their shapes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, how do I prevent losing the shape when using `union`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prevent losing the shape when using `union`, you need to ensure that the original expression type is preserved. This means that the fields you select from each set in the union should be consistent. If the shapes are different, you may need to explicitly select common fields or use type casting to align the shapes before performing the union."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I see. Could you show me an example with some code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course! Let's say you have two types, `Movie` and `Series`, with different properties. If you want to union them without losing shape, you would select common fields like this:\n\n```edgeql\nSELECT (\n    WITH\n        M := (SELECT Movie {id, title, release_year}),\n        S := (SELECT Series {id, title, release_year})\n    UNION (M, S)\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, both `Movie` and `Series` have the fields `id`, `title`, and `release_year` selected, so the shape is preserved in the union."}]}

Let's say you have a query where you're filtering a list of movies by a certain director, but within that query, you want to count all movies in the database, not just the ones by that director.

By using `detached`, you're telling EdgeDB to count all `Movie` entries as if you're running a separate, top-level query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That's pretty neat. Does it work with module aliases as well?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `detached` expressions do take into account module aliases.

For example, if you define `average_rating` inside a subquery or a different 'with' block, it might be calculated differently based on the new context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it, so the context where I define the alias is crucial.

In EdgeDB, when you're dealing with time durations, it's important to be aware of the concept of 'size classes.' These are categories of time units that are logical breakpoints, beyond which it's not reliable to convert values. For example, a month can vary in length - it could be 30, 28, 29, or 31 days.

Additionally, be aware of the context in which you're using these durations. For example, if you're working with scheduling or billing systems where precision is crucial, you'll want to ensure that your calculations account for these irregularities.

The 'is' operator in EdgeQL is used for type checking. It allows you to check if a given expression, let's call it 'A', is an instance of a type 'B' or any of 'B's subtypes. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, please show me an example."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, let's say we have a type 'Person' and a subtype 'Employee' which is derived from 'Person'. If you want to check if a variable 'person_var' is an instance of 'Employee', you would use the 'is' operator like this:\n```eql\nSELECT person_var IS Employee;\n```This query will return a boolean value: 'true' if 'person_var' is an instance of 'Employee' or its subtypes, and 'false' otherwise."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What about checking against multiple types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can use a comma-separated list of types with the 'is' operator to check if the left operand is of any of the types provided.

In EdgeDB, the type union operator is denoted by a vertical bar `|`. It's used to create a union of types, which means it refers to any value that is of either type on either side of the operator. This is particularly useful when you want to check if a value is one of several types using the `is` or `is not` operators. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, please show me an example of how to use it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure thing! Let's say you have two types in your database, `Person` and `Robot`. If you want to check if a variable `entity` is either a `Person` or a `Robot`, you can use the type union operator like this:\n```eql\nselect entity is Person | Robot;\n```This query will return `true` if `entity` is of type `Person` or `Robot`, and `false` otherwise."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What happens if I use it with the `is not` operator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you use the type union operator with `is not`, you're checking if the value is not any of the types in the union.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hey, I'm trying to understand type casting in EdgeDB. Can you explain it to me?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! In EdgeDB, type casting is an operation that allows you to convert a value from one type to another. It's done using the type cast operator, which is denoted by a '<type>' followed by the value you want to cast. Would you like to see an example?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, please show me an example of how to use the type cast operator."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright, let's say you have a string '123' and you want to cast it to an integer. You would use the type cast operator like this:\n```eql\nSELECT <int64>'123';\n```\nThis will convert the string '123' to the integer 123. The type you're casting to must be a valid non-abstract scalar or a container type, and the operation is performed at run-time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What happens if the cast fails? Does it throw an error?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, if the cast cannot be performed, EdgeDB will throw a run-time error. For example, if you try to cast a string that doesn't represent a valid number to an integer, like this:\n```eql\nSELECT <int64>'abc';\n```\nYou'll get an error because 'abc' is not a valid integer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it. Can I also cast to container types like arrays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! You can cast to container types such as arrays. For instance, if you want to cast a set of integers to an array of integers, you could do something like this:\n```eql\nSELECT <array<int64>>{1, 2, 3};\n```\nThis will create an array of integers containing [1, 2, 3]."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks, that makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about type casting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome! Just remember that type casting is a powerful tool, but you should use it judiciously.

The 'introspect type' operator is used for static type introspection in EdgeDB. It allows you to retrieve information about a type's definition within the schema. When you use this operator, it returns the introspection type corresponding to the type you provide as an operand."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you show me an example of how to use it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's say you want to get information about a scalar type like 'str'.

And I assume that UUIDs are used for relations between objects as well?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly! UUIDs are used to establish relations between objects. For instance, if you have a `Book` type and an `Author` type, you might define a link from `Book` to `Author` using the UUIDs.
