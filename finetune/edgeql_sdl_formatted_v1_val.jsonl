Without `detached`, the subquery `SELECT Person.friends FILTER Person = Person` would be comparing each `Person` to themselves within the scope of their friends, which is not what we want. By using `detached`, we're specifying that we want to compare against the entire set of `Person` objects in the database, not just the scoped subset."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it, that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome! If you have any more questions about EdgeDB or need further assistance, feel free to ask."}]}
